                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In the context of searching for agricultural landscapes which have escaped recent
                        anthropogenic disturbance, the evidence of the Kislovodsk basin (North Caucasus) has special
                        importance. Its sheltered location and the fact that it is relatively well-studied, enable us to
                        create, for the first time in Russia, an archaeological Geographic Information System (GIS) for
                        the microregion, which currently includes data on over 920 archaeological sites, from the
                        Aeneolithic to modern times. Preliminary analysis of the archaeological record of the Kislovodsk
                        basin has revealed that the Early Medieval period dating to the fifth - eight centuries AD was
                        characterised by the highest population density. The Site Catchment Analysis used in the
                        framework of GIS revealed over 120 fortified and unfortified settlements of the early medieval
                        Alanic tribes. The investigation consisted of several stages in the course of which potential
                        ploughing areas were modelled for each settlement. It was based on the combined archaeological
                        and soil field survey around fortified settlements in the different parts of the area. It
                        appears that from the fifth to the eighth centuries AD relatively flat territories of 1 km round
                        the site were the most valuable for agriculture. The rest of the economic area, simulated using
                        Thiessen tessellation, could have been used for pasture and hay-making. Computer simulation of
                        the potential economic territories gives the possibility to determine the area of proposed
                        ploughing and pasture holdings and to estimate the quantity of settled population along with
                        their cattle. As a result, a modelling thesis of a small dimension of the patronymic society of
                        the Alans who occupied these early medieval settlements and the affirmation of self-sufficiency
                        of their economy were confirmed.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Questo contributo si propone di analizzare in maniera organica alcuni dati significativi,
                        emersi combinando gli studi delle due autrici, in merito alle trasformazione dei modelli urbani
                        e produttivi nella Cilicia Tracheia/Isauria nel periodo tardo romano e protobizantino. Da una
                        prima analisi emerge un quadro della regione piuttosto complesso e articolato che vede un
                        territorio ricco di centri urbani a cui si alternano aree rurali dedite alla produzione agricola
                        e alla lavorazione delle materie prime e che attraversa in questo periodo (IV – metà VII secolo)
                        una fase di evidente incremento dell’attività commerciale, proiettando le città della costa
                        dell’Isauria nelle rotte mediterranee fino in Occidente. Un tale mutamento nell’assetto
                        economico, però, non può prescindere da una crescita dell’attività produttiva che raggiunge una
                        portata inedita e che si manifesta principalmente nella coltivazione della vite e dell’ulivo e
                        nella commercializzazione di vino e olio. Dal punto di vista archeologico ciò si riscontra, per
                        esempio, nella diffusione sul territorio extraurbano di impianti legati principalmente alla
                        produzione di olio e vino e nella presenza considerevole, soprattutto in contesti cittadini, di
                        fornaci per la fabbricazione di contenitori da trasporto: la produzione sembra non più volta a
                        soddisfare il solo fabbisogno locale, ma razionalizzata in maniera tale da garantire un surplus
                        di materie prime destinate al commercio. In questo contesto doveva essere fondamentale il
                        sistema integrato aree rurali – città costiere, basato sulla produzione nelle prime e sulla
                        commercializzazione delle merci nelle seconde, malgrado resti ancora di difficile comprensione
                        il sistema amministrativo che doveva regolare i rapporti tra le due realtà. D’altra parte, nello
                        studio integrato di tali dinamiche si riscontrano ancora numerose problematiche che si auspica
                        possano essere superate attraverso l’acquisizione di nuovi dati e ulteriori indagini sul
                        territorio.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The site of Caričin Grad in south-eastern Serbia – currently listed on UNESCO’s tentative
                        list – has been the subject of archaeological investigations for more than 100 years. For the
                        last decades it has been the focus of a joint project of the Archaeological Institute in
                        Belgrade and the École Française de Rome. A reconstruction of the economic, environmental and
                        social history of the city is the main objective of a cooperative project started in 2014 with
                        the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz. The remains of the early Byzantine complex of
                        Caričin Grad show the features of a city built in the classical, Hellenistic-Roman tradition,
                        combined with ecclesiastical Christian architecture. Based on the comparison of Byzantine text
                        sources with the settlement’s topography and its architecture, Caričin Grad is supposed to be
                        identical to Iustiniana Prima, a city newly founded by the Emperor Justinian as the region’s
                        episcopal and administrative centre. With the period of occupation covering a mere 90 years,
                        from circa AD 530 to circa AD 615, the site allows a rare archaeological “snapshot” of a short
                        period of very intensive use, which furthermore remained undisturbed from later encroachments.
                        Due to these circumstances, Caričin Grad offers the unique opportunity to analyse a city at the
                        turn of the Late Antique era to the Early Medieval epoch and the complex issues associated with
                        periods of cultural transition. Based on the perspective of human ecology and social sciences,
                        the project will establish new approaches and investigate the concept of “city” during periods
                        of cultural transition by using methods of archaeozoology, archaeobotany, geoarchaeology, soil
                        science and GIS. The main topic addressed within this context, “Households, consumption and
                        everyday life” will deal with single domestic units concerning methods of production,
                        consumption and activity zones regarding comestible goods. This perspective on the town and its
                        consumption will be complemented by a viewpoint on the surrounding landscape focussing on its
                        resources and agrarian production.

                        evidence with the spatial analysis offered by the application of new technologies in

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The Contessa Entellina survey is an intensive and systematic archaeological survey carried
                        out in western Sicily, on an area extending over 136.4 km2, out of which more than 114 km2 were
                        physically covered. The observation of settlement trends from the fourth to seventh centuries
                        shows, on first glance, a noticeable drop in the number of sites from the third to fourth
                        centuries, a new rise in the fifth century and a dramatic fall around the end of the century,
                        followed by a period of stability or slow decrease throughout the sixth and seventh centuries. A
                        more detailed analysis reveals, on the other hand, a much higher density of fifth century
                        diagnostic artefacts (per site and per settled hectare), when compared with the previous and the
                        two following centuries. The fifth century is therefore much more “visible” on the ground, and
                        this may have contributed to the higher identification of fifth century sites. The massive
                        presence of fifth century artefacts may not be exclusively due to a population increase:
                        economic and socio-cultural factors most likely also came into play, distorting the resulting
                        settlement picture. More precisely, a possible higher tendency towards a grain monoculture may
                        have caused a massive import of African foodstuffs (attested by amphorae) between the late
                        fourth and the middle fifth century, and peculiar dietary customs could explain the
                        all-pervading diffusion of African Red Slip Ware cups belonging to the form Hayes 80-81.
                        Similarly, if we take into consideration also less diagnostic artefacts such as roof tiles, we
                        find that the fall in the number of sites between the end of the fifth and the sixth-seventh
                        centuries may have been less drastic than it appears, and that it was followed by attempts to
                        work out new settlement strategies, showing a fairly good resilience.

                    <jats:p>Sulphur was important in several fields: military, tanning, wool’s disinfection and many
                        other activities. Nevertheless, the largest quantity of sulphur was used in agriculture,
                        particularly in viticulture as it was used to combat fungal diseases especially in wine
                        production areas. Sicily, and in particular the area surrounding Agrigento, was the main site of
                        sulphur extraction. This built strong relationships with Rome and other agricultural centres in
                        the Mediterranean Sea. Very important among the historical sources and the archaeological
                        evidence are the so called Tabulae sulphuris, concerning the sulphur exploitation at the
                        Agrigento’s area. Recent finds and studies gave a new chronology dating to a few of the tegulae
                        sulphuris and the related sulphur exploitation between the end of the fourth and the sixth
                        centuries. It is now possible to attribute to Sicily (in particular, the “area solfifera”) the
                        trade relationships which arose in Classical times. We must connect these commercial and
                        cultural ties to the export of wheat and other commodities. The main goal of this paper is to
                        show new data on the exploitation structures and the transformation of the mining landscape
                        between Late Antiquity and the Byzantine Age. During this time, Agrigentum lost its function as
                        fiscal centre, maybe because other centres were acquiring this role.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In the period between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, the territory of L’Aquila
                        underwent a number of transformations that also occurred elsewhere. The cities (Amiternum,
                        Civita di Bagno, Peltuinum, Aufinum) suffered a heavy setback in their urban and economic
                        development because of the general crisis of the Empire, the devastating effects of earthquakes
                        in the second half of the fourth century, the Greek-Gothic war, the barbarian migrations and
                        last, but not least, the changes in society and the ideological-cultural transformation induced
                        by Christianisation. The relationship between town and country / city and territory undergoes
                        fundamental changes, with different connotations in terms of landscape and settlements. The
                        archaeological research and excavation of the surface, which we have carried out in the
                        territory of L’Aquila for over a decade, is beginning to provide evidence of the results of the
                        urban and rural landscape transformations: the Christianisation of space and functional
                        transformation of major public and private facilities are confirmed by the discovery of churches
                        replacing temples, as in Centurelli and in Piana San Marco and so on. Other evidence is provided
                        by citadels obtained through the restoration of theatres and amphitheatres or city gates, as in
                        the restorations and transformations of Peltuinum and Amiternum. We can also mention functional
                        transformations such as private domus, sometimes with a long occupation of public spaces, such
                        as in Amiternum and Peltuinum, or the defunctionalisation of infrastructures such as thermal
                        complexes, roads, aqueducts and sewers. Homes or wooden cabins occupy the scene in the Amiternum
                        theatre; churches like Santa Maria of Ansedonia abut the city walls. The rural landscape is
                        changing for many reasons: the spread of Christian places of worship, the collapsing of public
                        infrastructures such as roads or waterways, the advancement of wetlands and uncultivated areas
                        and grazing activities to the detriment of agricultural areas. By the seventh century there is a
                        further change in urban and agro-pastoral planning, which will be illustrated with concrete
                        examples provided by the archaeological research we are carrying out.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This paper draws its origin from a series of archaeological interventions led by the
                        Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici della provincia Autonoma di Trento under the supervision
                        of Cristina Bassi in the area called “piana Benacense”, a fertile plain near Riva del Garda, in
                        the northern part of Lake Garda. The results of the excavation that took place in San Cassiano
                        (2005-2006) are debated along with related anthropological studies. The site, placed beside the
                        current Via Marone, follows the layout of an ancient Roman street characterised by the presence
                        of burial areas. The area, about 6000 m2, presented the existence of a road that divided a Roman
                        villa from two separated burial areas (dated respectively to the third and fourth centuries AD).
                        The Roman villa, with structures that are dated from the first to the fourth centuries AD,
                        included a large productive area better identified after the anthropological analysis of the
                        individuals buried in the southern necropolis. In this area there were both incinerations and
                        inhumations graves, all characterised by the same markers of osteological stress compatible to
                        wool manufacturing. The smaller northern burial area was built for wealthier people, sometimes
                        showing the traces of similar work activities. In the fifth-sixth centuries the landscape
                        totally changed and a church was built, hosting a few high-status graves. The analysis of human
                        remains revealed that all the individuals were males and showed the so-called “horseman
                        syndrome” with some trauma fractures. We suppose that this leading group commissioned the
                        church. After the fifth century, data agree upon a generalised implosion of economic structures,
                        as confirmed by the markers of occupational stress on bones. Therefore the crossing of
                        archeological and anthropological results trace the landscape history of the Benacense plain,
                        from the well-organised and productive Roman period to a period lacking organisation and
                        economic structures. This is the reason San Cassiano could be considered a significant component
                        for the historical reconstruction of the Garda area in “the time of change”.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In the early Christian period the birth and development of relics’ cult led to the
                        transformation of urban, suburban and rural Italian landscape. Indeed, the deposition of
                        venerated bodies in extra-muros cemeteries led to the gradual Christianisation of the whole
                        peninsula. The link between territories and martyrs’ cults is shown by Christian Calendars,
                        which reported just the dies natalis and the place of depositio. The saints were so
                        territorially well established that their burials were simply considered as loca by ancient
                        Christians. The gradual monumentalisation of martyrs’ tombs led to the birth of huge
                        sanctuaries. They were composed of funerary and religious buildings but also service facilities,
                        accommodations for pilgrims and monasteries. The most important sanctuaries were those of Saints
                        Peter in the Vatican, Erasmus in Formia, Alexander in Nomentum, Felix in Cimitile, Januarius in
                        Naples, Felix in Venosa, Marcianus in Syracuse and the Apostles in Concordia. They became so
                        popular that Jerome said: ‘movetur urbs sedibus suis’. It seems that sometimes there was a
                        coincidence between sanctuaries and episcopal palaces, such as in Sardinia, in some part of
                        Latium and probably at Cimitile, Venosa and Concordia Sagittaria. In the fifth and sixth
                        centuries some sanctuaries spread also in rural areas, usually along important routes. Suburban
                        and rural sanctuaries led to the development of new settlements, as shown by the birth of new
                        villages. The current word “Cimitile”, for example, derives from “Cimiterium” and even Paulinus
                        of Nola wrote about a vicus nearby the sanctuary. At Saint Peter’s tomb, a Civitas was born in
                        the Early Middle Ages. At the end of the Early Christian era, the traslationes broke the tie
                        between relics and their locus depositionis, causing new urban sanctuaries to form.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This research focuses on the process of late transformation and final abandonment of Roman
                        towns, on the Christianisation phenomenon and on the late antique evolution of settlement
                        patterns in central Lusitania. The traditional explanations of sudden abandonments of Roman
                        centres, due to “external” events, were swept away by a more scientific approach to
                        archaeological evidence. The article presents data on the Late Antiquity phases of Ammaia and
                        Ebora Iulia (today Évora). The results of a long period of archaeo-topographical research on the
                        deserted Roman town of Ammaia (Marvão, Portugal), supported by international scientific
                        collaborations, disclose new scenarios. On the basis of the survey data, integrated with the
                        results of the recent ground-truthing excavations, it is possible to state that, from the
                        beginning of the fourth century AD, the town seemed to be interested in a process of
                        transformation and not of degradation. Évora was a bigger town and it was, from the fourth
                        century AD, the seat of the diocese. In fact, it was one of the first towns of Lusitania and its
                        bishop was present at the Council of Elvira (306/314 AD). Évora, unlike Ammaia, had continuity
                        of occupation and therefore archaeological research has to deal with the problems usually
                        connected with urban archaeology. The intention is to draw a short summary about the
                        transformations that characterise the two towns in this period and, finally, identify common
                        elements and differences.

                    <jats:p>Archaeomorphology, the study of human-made landscape forms such as roads, field systems,
                        terraces, water channels, etc. is an important part of landscape studies. The archaeological
                        features studied through archaeomorphological approaches display a long-term chronology and play
                        an important role in the configuration of human habitat, movement and sustenance. In many cases,
                        this role can still be appreciated in today’s cultural landscapes. However, during the last
                        decades the archaeomorphological study of centuriations and other field systems has been
                        considered a marginal and unscientific discipline. This is largely due to the multiplication of
                        unreliable archaeomorphological studies on centuriations developed from the 70s to the 90s, some
                        of which have been proved wrong by large-scale archaeological excavations. Nonetheless, the last
                        decade has seen a revival of centuriation and other archaeomorphology-based studies. Events such
                        as the 2009 international conference The application of centurial systems and methods of
                        agrarian organisation from the Roman period to the early Middle Ages or the publication of Agri
                        Centuriati, an International Journal of Landscape Archaeology beginning in 2004 have helped to
                        put this discipline “back on the map”.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In this work we intend to illustrate methods and tools used for evaluating and defining some
                        of the post-depositional processes of the archaeological record in the Eastern Beneventan
                        landscapes. Our research aims especially to recognise the traces of the “longue durée”
                        phenomena, highlighting what may be considered a result of the past still observable in the
                        present. Which are the tools that allow us to identify landscapes marks, anthropogenic and
                        environmental processes responsible of the survival or, conversely, of the obliteration of the
                        ancient forms? A first approach attempts to create a dialogic relationship with the historical
                        cartographic documents (such as ancient cadastres, notarial instruments, boundary disputes) and
                        sheds light on the dynamics of the perceptible transformations of landscapes, bringing back an
                        overall view of their contextual distinctive traits. This ensures the identification of
                        “ecofacts” and “artefacts” that contributes to the structuration of the landscapes that have
                        occurred over time as stratified units. A second procedure involves the reading of the
                        historical information combined with the environmental one, through an archaeomorphological
                        approach. The study has provided an overlap among the ancient and modern rural fabrics (for
                        example roads, canals, talwegs, agrarian boundaries) and the geomorphological dynamics, with the
                        aim of discerning the forms of degradation and to define, when possible, a relative chronology.
                        Such an approach evaluates the distribution of surface artefacts and their spatial and temporal
                        characteristics, enabling recording of the higher or lower level of degradation in the
                        archaeological record, emphasising those landscapes units considered of high information

                    <jats:p>In this paper we analyse the contribution that archaeomorfological analysis of road networks
                        can bring to the study of landscape dynamics, focusing on the study case of the low Venetian
                        plain between Padua and Rovigo. Methodologically, we found our work on a study published by Eric
                        Vion in 1989 where, for the first time, the Swiss scholar defended the importance of the
                        morphological study of communication routes to understand the historical evolution of a
                        territory. By applying the basic principles of this method, we have analysed the territory in
                        order to highlight its main evolutionary stages.So we could establish that, after a series of
                        interventions dating back to Protohistoric times, the first real large-scale landscape
                        structuration was carried out by the Romans, initially (second century BC) by drafting a series
                        of extra regional routes designed to connect the northernmost colony of Aquileia with the
                        southern strongholds of Ariminum, Mutina, and Bononia and, later (first century BC-first century
                        AD), by implementing the road network through the realization of new routes and at least three
                        different centuriated field systems in the territories controlled by Patavium, Ateste and
                        Atria.With the fall of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity, all these infrastructures had to
                        be partly abandoned and partly re-functionalized by seconding the changed needs of the rural
                        population. Around the 10th century, it seems possible to date the first setting of a series of
                        so-called radial systems that deeply modify the previous centurial infrastructures, while
                        between 11th and 13th centuries, a series of interventions on the road network were promoted by
                        the city of Padua. Finally, from fifteenth to eighteenth century, new interventions
                        (construction of new roads and channels and reclamation works) were carried out, especially in
                        the lagoon area, by the government of Venice Republic.In this paper we analyse the contribution
                        that archaeomorfological analysis of road networks can bring to the study of landscape dynamics,

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The historic territory of Valencia is being analysed in the frame of a new research project,
                        Valentia Landscape Project, aiming to characterise the dynamics of the Valencian Cultural
                        Landscape from the Iron Age (seventh - sixth century BC) to the Modern period. An important part
                        of the project is focused on Antiquity and one of its major goals is reviewing through a new
                        archaeomorphological analysis, the ancient road network, in order to study historical field
                        systems and to analyse the centuriation hypothesis proposed up to now. The archaeomorphological
                        analysis has allowed us to propose new hypothesis about the origin and dynamics of the Valencian
                        Cultural Landscape. In this sense, the study has attested the presence, in the present
                        landscape, of many axes whose origin is related to the Roman centuriated road system.
                        Multidisciplinarity and a long-term approach have brought a high level of precision to this
                        work’s results.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This paper explores the advantages of using satellite remote sensing and GIS to identify
                        ancient land divisions in the eastern Mediterranean by studying the organisation of modern
                        agrarian landscapes. Since current land divisions sometimes retain the arrangement of an older
                        system, either wholly or partially, remote sensing methodologies have been successful in
                        distinguishing ancient demarcations, especially Roman centuriation. This study places emphasis
                        on techniques to recover past landscapes around settlements where the correlation between modern
                        agrarian divisions and a potential ancient system is not clear from visual interpretation.
                        Within GIS the dominant orientations of modern agrarian fields are analysed and presented as
                        histograms which show general trends in the organisation of land. These methodologies are
                        applied in two case-studies where the evidence for an ancient urban or rural land division is
                        not well-defined: Mantinea, a classical Greek city in the Peloponnese, and Aphrodisias, a Late
                        Hellenistic foundation in western Anatolia. The histograms identify trends in the organisation
                        of modern fields that might mark the presence of an ancient system of land demarcation. The data
                        from Mantinea show that the majority of modern agricultural fields inside the fortification
                        walls have dominant orientations identical to the alignments of excavated buildings and a series
                        of streets revealed through geophysical survey. Likewise, there is evidence at Aphrodisias that
                        rural land outside the fortification walls share orientations with urban features inside the
                        city. Both examples show that an analysis of the dominant angle frequency of modern land
                        divisions is useful for reconstructing the archaeomorphology of ancient landscapes in the
                        eastern Mediterranean.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The French Rhône valley has traces of ancient roman parcels, testified by antique land
                        registers called “Orange cadastre”. This organisation was highlighted on the left bank of the
                        river and it seems to extend to the other side, in the Tave and Cèze valleys. All this research
                        was conducted in the 80s from the French National Institute of Cartography (IGN) aerial missions
                        using the method of optical filtering. In this study, we intend to use a GIS and the cadastral
                        map in vector format (BDParcellaire® product from IGN). Indeed, the cadastre enables the study
                        of boundaries that have no materialisation in the current landscape. The aerial photographs or
                        topographical maps only give incomplete information, i.e. the perennial human forms or roads,
                        paths, fences, channels, ditches. These documents are selective. The tool used in this study is
                        the histogram of directions. It consists in calculating the azimuth of each parcel boundary and
                        drawing a histogram. The number of boundaries or their total length is shown as a function of
                        the azimuth. The interests of working with the cadastre are that all information are contained
                        in these documents, their precision allows a detailed study of cadastral frames. This method was
                        first validated on previously studied areas and then extended to the Cèze and Tave lower
                        valleys. This helped to detect the presence of “Orange cadastre” in these two valleys, where the
                        method by optical filtering had not delivered convincing results. The use of these vector data
                        for the detection of ancient cadastral frames permits a detailed study of the boundaries
                        structure. The results are encouraging and allow the consideration of new approaches. It would
                        be interesting to combine elevation and topographic data as well as ancient “Napoleonic
                        cadastre” with the aim to eliminate nineteenth and twentieth century boundaries.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The territorial organisation of rural areas in the context of the Roman Empire is a widely
                        discussed issue in archaeomorphological research but it is also a topic of great interest for
                        the study of long-term landscapes dynamics. Most of these studies deal with large territorial
                        management works related to known ancient cities. In this paper we propose a discussion about a
                        study case carried out on a much more reduced scale, focused in a small river valley, placed in
                        an inland area near Barcelona in the North-Eastern sector of the Iberian Peninsula. In this
                        research both the analysis of road network from aerial photographs and the study of settlement
                        patterns from the Archaeological Heritage database are complemented by fieldwork, survey and the
                        regressive analysis of historical maps. A geomorphological study of the area is actually in
                        progress. A significant relationship has been highlighted between an ancient Roman road and an
                        intensive settlement network along this historical road axis. Settlement distribution along the
                        studied stretch seems to show a pattern related to well-known measures used in Roman
                        land-surveys. According to the chronology of these sites, this spatial organisation may coincide
                        with the consolidation processes of a Roman urban network at the Tarraconensis province. This
                        process took place during the first century BC, especially from the second half of that century.
                        In this paper, the results will be discussed and analysed in order to understand how far the
                        data available allow us to interpret landscape organisation in relation to geomorphological and
                        environmental dynamics.

                        practicalities of land measurement in the Roman world. It discusses ways in which the
                        Agrimensores might be used, not only based on a strict literal reading of the texts, but on the
                        practical circumstances in which these works could be used. The paper combines the statements of
                        the Agrimensores with evidence from Roman literary and legal sources and from archaeology. It
                        uses the colony Arausio, modern Orange in southern France, as a case study. The paper concludes
                        that the works of the Agrimensores was based on real situations, examples of which can be found
                        in the map of Arausio. The Agrimensores therefore attempted to give general instructions based
                        on situations they had encountered in the field. Sometimes these seem overly schematic or
                        abstract, but this matches the style of Roman legal writing. It is true that the works of the
                        Agrimensores have often been misused in scholarly research, but the paper argues that these
                        texts can be of great value when used in combination with archaeological evidence and other
                        legal and technical texts. Thus, these works can be used to gain a better understanding of the
                        practicalities of Roman land measurement.

                    <jats:p>The paper presents a multidisciplinary research project (“Archaeology of Commons: cultural
                        Heritage and Material Evidence of a Disappearing Europe”) on the archaeology of common-lands.
                        The main goal of the project is to investigate, by means of historical and archaeological
                        analysis, the intimate social dimension at the base of the common lands management in the
                        context of southern European mountainous regions. Research investigates the dynamic nature of
                        commons starting from the reconstruction of the present organisation of common lands, going back
                        to the complex transformations of common properties in the nineteenth century and analysing the
                        problem of the archaeological visibility of conflicts since the ancien régime. The project will
                        examine how archaeological methods could clarify different aspects of the history of the
                        collective access rights to land, by applying in selected mountain areas methodological
                        approaches based on historical ecology, rural and agrarian archaeology.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>An exploitation system of rock quarries was investigated along a tract of the ancient Appian
                        Way extending between the modern villages of Itri and Fondi (central Italy). Three new quarries
                        carved into carbonatic slopes were discovered through interpretation of aerial photography and
                        photogrammetric restitution (this last still in progress) nearby a few extraction areas already
                        acknowledged in previous works. Later, field surveys confirmed the anthropogenic nature of slope
                        cuts as inferred from squared or rectangular morphological edges and evidence of regular
                        tool-marks. Quarries location and exploitation techniques were analysed in relation to the
                        archaeological requirements for the road construction and maintenance and also considering the
                        geological setting of the area. In particular, it was demonstrated how geometric characteristics
                        of rock masses – such as bedding and joint system spacing or intensity of brittle deformation –
                        played a fundamental role in determining the kind of extracted material and use of different
                        exploitation techniques. Indeed, cubic and pseudo-cubic rock blocks were extracted from quarries
                        A and B during the Roman Age, as evidenced by peculiar tool-marks observed on the rock slope
                        edges and tracing intersecting joint system. Quarry C was instead an open-pit derived from a
                        cataclastic rock volume in the hanging-wall of a main normal fault and from which
                        centimetres-sized debris were derived. The present study set the basis for a further analysis of
                        the local exploitation system which may include other minor quarries used for road maintenance
                        works and construction of other buildings.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The project presented in this paper is concerned with the funeral rite of the Tumulus
                        cultural community located on the border of Silesia and Greater Poland. Detailed
                        multi-disciplinary analyses have been applied to a unique slice of the Bronze Age cultural
                        landscape preserved within the cover of a 100-year old oak forest known as the Krotoszyn Forest.
                        Preliminary research carried out by the author (rescue excavations, non-invasive prospection and
                        airborne laser scanning) revealed the existence of 120 barrows, which are likely to be
                        associated with the dominance of the Tumulus Culture in areas of south-west Poland. The
                        information obtained by previous studies was included in the spatial database available to the
                        author. It provides basic information on the location, state of preservation and the amount of
                        burial mounds in the area of the Krotoszyn Forest. The main aim of the project is to carry out
                        multi-dimensional spatial analysis in order to capture the relationship between the variables
                        governing the environment and Tumulus Culture burials. The methodological approach adopted by
                        the project consists of the GIS analysis of data obtained from the airborne laser scanning,
                        palaeoenvironmental studies and the application of geophysical prospection. The project’s
                        targets include the development of an interpretative model able to explain the rules of location
                        and strategies of construction of the funeral space of the Tumulus Culture community. The
                        proposed models will be drawn upon theoretical reflections related to the concept of landscape
                        archaeology.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>La valle della Caffarella ricade all’interno del Parco Regionale dell’Appia Antica e si
                        trova al di fuori delle Mura Aureliane, tra la via Latina e via dell’Appia Antica, tagliata
                        verso sud da via dell’Almone. La valle di origine alluvionale è costituita da pianori sommitali
                        tufacei, versanti leggermente scoscesi ed un fondovalle ricco di falde acquifere e di numerose
                        sorgenti di acque minerali. Particolarmente rilevante è la presenza del fiume Almone sacro ai
                        Romani, ancora oggi terzo fiume di Roma per portata, e dei fossi alimentati dalle numerose
                        sorgenti locali, note già in epoca romana. Anticamente nella valle della Caffarella si
                        sviluppava un reticolo idrografico molto più complesso di quello attuale. Le originarie aree
                        paludose connaturate alla geomorfologia della valle, sono state bonificate nel corso dei secoli
                        tramite una serie di opere idrauliche, come canali di convogliamento e drenaggio di varie epoche
                        o la creazione in età moderna di fossi scaricatori regolati da chiuse detti anche “marrane” o
                        “incastri”. Molti di questi manufatti sono visibili o rintracciabili ancora oggi nella valle e
                        testimoniano le numerose attività antropiche realizzate per il controllo delle acque in
                        superficie. Mettendo insieme le informazioni ottenute da cartografia storica, foto aeree,
                        sopralluoghi e documentazione degli scavi archeologici recenti, si può offrire un contributo
                        alla ricostruzione della idrografia storica di questo lembo di campagna romana di grande
                        interesse ambientale e storico archeologico (fig. 1).

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In this paper,we discuss the results of an artefact survey and a sampling collection in the
                        indigenous settlement of Terravecchia di Cuti, in the chora of the Greek colony of Himera
                        (Sicily). The whole area of the town was gridded with squares of 10x10 m to isolate functional
                        areas and identify the most interesting zones for new archaeological samples. The survey was
                        carried out in two fields (9400 m2), counting and recording all findings. Only diagnostic
                        pottery and figured pottery, antefixes, loom weights, millstones and so on were collected. We
                        can observe, analysing in detail our results for both fields, that functional areas could not be
                        isolated, perhaps because the urban and social organisation of the settlement did not provide
                        for clear distinctions. The multi-functionality of everyday objects, also, does not allow us to
                        recognise these areas. Finally, we must consider the effect of decades of ploughing carried out
                        on the site.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Mountains and high ground are often venerated as special places. It is their enigmatic
                        quality as elevated ground, their prominence and permanence in both the mental and physical
                        landscapes that draws us to them. In this paper the role of mountains in current landscape
                        archaeology is discussed based on their role as places of significance in both “visible” and
                        “invisible” landscapes. The conspicuous mountain of Turlough Hill, in the Burren, Co. Clare has
                        on its summit a unique group of prehistoric remains consisting of some 140 circular houses, a
                        large burial cairn, a multi-vallate enclosure as well as an extraordinary hexagonal stone
                        enclosure. Why did people choose this particular mountaintop as the focus for this extraordinary
                        activity in prehistory? To answer this question, and to elucidate the wider question of the
                        significance of high ground, as well as aspects of place-making, the role of Turlough Hill in
                        prehistory is discussed based on the character of the archaeological remains, but also on the
                        character of the mountain itself and its location in the wider landscape.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Ruvo di Puglia is located in the continuity of life in central Puglia. It stands on a hill
                        located between the area Murgia and the Adriatic coast. The first traces of the area date back
                        to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic and the phase is documented peuceta with numerous monumental
                        tombs with rich graves. At the beginning of the third century BC, Ruvo becomes a member before
                        becoming municipium after the social war. The survival of the city was guaranteed by the Via
                        Minucia which connected Benevento to Brindisi through Puglia. This road will become the Traiana
                        in Imperial times, ensuring continuity of life in the city. Nevertheless, the town lost its
                        hegemony and was greatly reduced. One of the few pieces of epigraphic evidence of Roman attests
                        to the presence of a surrounding wall of which no trace remains: what is preserved material
                        dates from the Aragonese domination. The attention is focused on the origins of Ruvo in the
                        early nineteenth century, following the random discoveries of rich grave peuceta. This
                        phenomenon contributes to wage a “excavations fever” and plundering of a necropolis with
                        consequent destruction of the ancient urban fabric. Encouraged by Borbonic Government, the
                        results of these excavations went to increase the actual collection of the Museum Borbonico of
                        Naples and private collections around the world.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>TResearch is aimed at the production of a tool that could be useful both for the
                        reconstruction of the ancient urban planning and its development during the Greek, Roman and
                        Medieval ages, and for the management and preservation of the archaeological heritage of
                        Taormina; in fact, the new archaeological map could be included in policies aimed at an urban
                        development that respects the existing ancient remains and promotes their enhancement of value.
                        The paper concerns the research project started in 2009 and aimed at the production of the
                        archaeological map of Tauromenion/Tauromenium, on which the modern Taormina lies. The project is
                        carried out by the Department of Ancient and Modern Cultures of the University of Messina and
                        the Institute for Archaeological and Monumental Heritage of the Italian National Research
                        Council, with the cooperation of the Archaeological Superintendence of the Province of Messina
                        and the Archaeological Park of Giardini Naxos. The research project involves a context
                        characterised by a long continuity of life during centuries and it is based on:1) archaeological
                        and topographical surveys using a differential GPS system and a total station;2) systematic
                        study and analysis of archival documentation, previous bibliographies and historical
                        cartographies;3) interpretation of aerial photos, in particular those taken between the years
                        1920s and 1940s, when some sectors of the ancient city and necropolises were not still covered
                        by the extension of the modern town. All the collected data were georeferenced in a digital
                        archaeological map, where all the ancient monuments and structures, both still visible and those
                        re-buried after small-scale excavations, are integrated on a up-to-date large-scale vector
                        cartography. The map is integrated in a web-oriented GIS platform developed using open source
                        software and cloud computing solutions; it is aimed at the data management and sharing between
                        the different institutions involved in the project. Therefore, the research is aimed at the
                        production of a tool that could be useful both for the reconstruction of the ancient urban
                        planning and its development during the Greek, Roman and Medieval ages, and for the management
                        and preservation of the archaeological heritage of Taormina; in fact, the new archaeological map
                        could be included in policies aimed at an urban development that respects the existing ancient
                        remains and promotes their enhancement of value.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The text synthesizes an analysis of the meaning and function of city walls through a series
                        of examples of urban settlements founded, or renewed, in cental-northern Italy, between the end
                        of the Republic and the First Imperial Age. A period in which, in different geographical areas,
                        different monumental results were produced. In some cases the need for defense is still relevant
                        and the structure of city walls, gates and towers, reveal this need. Despite the Pax Augusta,
                        the phenomenon of brigandage, in primis, imposes in some areas a certain attention to their
                        defensive function. In other cases, the city walls may have existed to perform functions
                        different than that of defensive; functions that are not limited only to a symbolic ritual
                        matrix. In this process, even the city gates are transformed, entering in symbiosis with the
                        monumental typology of the honorary arch and becoming, sometimes, a real commemorative monument
                        of particular events. The prestige of the location of this monumental typology in the city wall
                        is completely independent from the validity of the defensive walls. The city walls interact with
                        the doors and with the towers both functionally and formally. Now, their task is not to close
                        the village in a rigid internal/external alternative but rather to create a dialogue between the
                        reality of the settlement and what surrounds it. This dialogue takes place, thanks to the doors
                        and to other structures, both man-made, such as bridges, or natural, such as courses of water,
                        paying attention to the element of the spatial perspective, that emerges, now, in many cases of
                        urban renewal and thanks to which is created an interaction between the city and the outside
                        world.

                    <jats:p>The results of the surveys made in the Brindisi area, territory of Mesagne, have produced
                        new data demonstrating in the importance of systematic explorations to increase the knowledge of
                        the forms of territorial organisation. Between the main historical phases that have
                        characterised this area, we intend to present the one between the Roman Age and the Late
                        Antiquity. A period that, unlike other districts (even neighbouring), reveals for the Brindisi
                        area a clear increase of the rural population and deep changes in forms of land use.

                        prospecting and archaeological field survey. All research activity was done by the Laboratory of
                        Ancient Topography and Photogrammentry of the University of Salento. The executed explorative
                        interventions have considered the results of the data processed as well as all documents related
                        to the systematic surveys realised in the framework of the Ager Aquinas project. The substance
                        of the archaeological deposits, the wealth of ancient materials and the remains highlighted
                        constitute indicators of positive conditions for the planning of archaeological research
                        oriented to confirming all that was individuated by the field surveys, aerial photographs and
                        geophysical prospecting. These studies have allowed the reconstruction of the urban layout of
                        Aquinum. Planning for the archaeological interventions was based not only on the results but
                        also on the processing of data regarding field survey and on the compelling need for the
                        preservation of the area.Starting with the collected data, six archaeological excavation
                        campaigns have been carried out between 2009 and 2014 in Aquinum. The research, after confirming
                        the aerotopographical and geophysical results, focused on an area of the town that, until that
                        time, had provided nothing useful for the recognition of monuments and urban spaces. Great
                        results have been obtained thanks to the archaeological excavation campaigns led at the heart of
                        the ancient Roman town. Knowledge of a central part of the built-up area has improved including
                        where there are public buildings already known (theatre, an apsis-building) and unknown (public
                        thermal baths). This is the keystone for better protection of the archaeological site and to
                        future preservation for the area.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Research on the prehistoric and proto-historic landscape in Sardinia (Italy) allows
                        knowledge and analysis of the island’s archaeological heritage. Besides, recent studies have
                        aimed to delineate the type of relationship that the prehistoric and proto-historic societies
                        established with the variegated Sardinian landscape in connection with the ways of articulation
                        and territorial appropriation, without neglecting the important and fundamental aspect of
                        economic organisation of the territory. From this point of view, we want to analyse, as a
                        sample-area, the region that includes the communal territory of Mogoro, in central-western
                        Sardinia. Particularly we studied the ways of anthropisation and fruition of the landscape in
                        proto-historic age, with the objective to reconstruct, through the study of the settlements and
                        the relationships among them, some of the economic and social aspects of those groups of nuragic
                        culture that enjoyed this area from the Middle Bronze Age to the Iron Age. The area of Mogoro
                        has been intensively investigated from the half of the past century; the investigations then
                        culminated with the stratigraphical investigation carried out beginning in 1994 near the site of
                        Cuccurada, the main centre of an articulated territorial system including a rich network of
                        monuments related to the nuragic civilisation, such as nuraghi, giants’ tombs and villages. In
                        this work we present the results obtained through various research methods: geomorphological
                        analysis, spatial analyst GIS tools (Viewshed, Cost Surface and Least-cost path analyses) and
                        multivariate analysis (cluster and principal components analysis) that allow us to set a new
                        hypothesis on population dynamics in this area and to individuate, among proto-historical
                        monuments, one or more homogeneous and distinguished groups, starting from a database that
                        results from indexing geomorphological characteristics.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This paper is focused on investigating the prehistoric settlements of the Tavoliere di
                        Puglia (Foggia, South Italy) through the analysis of archaeological traces in historical and
                        recent aerial photographs, both vertical (IGM images taken in 1954 and in 1955, IRTA, AM and RAF
                        photographs, colour orthophotos) and oblique. As is well known, the plain of the Tavoliere was
                        densely inhabited during the Neolithic Age and analysis of aerial photographs showed noteworthy
                        examples of archaeological evidence related to topographical organisation of villages, delimited
                        by one or more ditches containing more or less dense series of compounds. Such complexes are
                        located, in most cases, near waterways that have sometimes dried up, in the areas interfluvial
                        or on plateaus and shallow edge of scarp; in the western sector of the territory not many
                        prehistoric settlements appear in aerial photographs and they are mainly located at slight
                        elevations, neighbouring modern farms. The georeferencing and graphic rendering of
                        archaeological traces of the Neolithic settlement allowed the measurement of their extension. In
                        some cases the analysis of archeological traces in aerial photographs have found a topographic
                        continuity between Neolithic settlements and Medieval fortifications, in areas characterised by
                        the presence of slight hills featuring geological outcrop (locally known as “crusta”); this data
                        has been confirmed by field survey. The interpretation of the many visible traces, their
                        geo-referencing and graphic rendering, combined with topographical survey make an important
                        contribution to the reconstruction of settlement dynamics of the prehistoric period. The
                        integrated study of the historical and recent aerial photos was particularly functional when
                        used to analyse archaeological contexts, no longer visible in recent aerial photos, and has
                        facilitated a detailed analysis of the archaeological traces. The georeferenced data were, in
                        part, controlled with field survey that has better defined the chronology of the archeological
                        traces.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Historic landscape and cultural heritage are often integrated into a system of protection
                        and valorisation through the global approach of archaeology and landscape archaeology. This
                        system is conceived as a territorial study collecting all the evidence of human presence and its
                        history, allowing the assessment of the historical and archaeological component through
                        evolutionary dynamics. Therefore the study of landscape archaeology is central to the design and
                        programming of territorial works. The “landscape system”, the result of the coexistence of
                        environmental and human dynamics, has meant that territorial transformation processes have
                        become the object of scientific interest assuming considerable political importance. In this
                        paper, we present the preliminary results of a geophysical prospections for a map of the
                        archaeological potential of the territory of Flumeri in Avellino, Italy. This diagnostic
                        contribution was designed to give a distinctive and better representation of the territory. The
                        scientific approach chosen for this project is the result of a multidisciplinary convergence:
                        bibliographical and archival research, analysis of topographic and photogrammetric surveys,
                        systematic investigations of the territory and geophysical survey. These diverse non-invasive
                        geophysical methods allowed us to define and detail the archaeological potential of the studied
                        area in a better way; by defining micro-areas of geophysical survey starting with defining
                        macro-areas of high archaeological potential. This approach has a double value: the geophysical
                        surveys serve as a support for the archaeological knowledge of the area and the archaeological
                        knowledge helps towards the identification of areas for geophysical survey.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The study area is located in the mid Calore valley, between the Calore and the Ufita Rivers.
                        From prehistoric times, the territory has constituted an important crossroad among Campania,
                        Apulia and Lucania, ensuring a connection between the Tyrrenian and Adriatic coast. The
                        importance of the area grew with the construction of the via Appia, in the third century BC.
                        Along its route, as documented by itinerary sources, in the early first century BC the
                        municipium of Aeclanum (Passo di Mirabella – Mirabella Eclano, AV) was founded. A significant
                        part of the research project regards this city: archaeological field surveys were carried out in
                        the urban area and along the city walls, still partially preserved, with the aim to clarify its
                        route. The new collected data were georeferenced in an aerophotogrammetric map, together with
                        the data deriving from 1960s archaeological excavations and systematic study of archival
                        documents of the Superintendence of Salerno, Avellino, Benevento and Caserta Province. The map
                        was realised in the LabTAF of the University of Salento and constitutes the first large scale
                        archaeological map of the ancient city. Systematic archaeological field walking was carried out
                        on the territory corresponding partially to the ager Aeclanensis. It aimed at the reconstruction
                        of the ancient topography of the territory surrounding the Roman site thanks to the large number
                        of settlements documented. These settlements attest to the inhabitation of the area since the
                        prehistoric and proto-historic times to the Medieval period. All collected data are
                        georeferenced in the archaeological map that also allows diachronic analyses of the territory.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Agricultural terraces have been a necessary element in the landscapes of Classical and
                        Hellenistic periods in many areas of the Greek world. These terraces, formed by long terrace
                        walls, shaped the slopes in the proximity of the farmhouses in order to facilitate exploitation
                        of the land by the farmers, providing all the necessary conditions for efficient and effective
                        cultivation of olive trees, grains, vines and almost any other crop. Various sites with
                        agricultural terraces in the area of Attica, especially in the territory of the ancient deme of
                        Atene (such as PH 2 in Aghia Photini and TH 18/42 in Thymari) as well as the Cycladic islands
                        (Delos and Kea), dated to the Classical and Hellenistic period, are provided in this paper as
                        some very characteristic examples of ancient terraced systems. Despite the thorough discussions
                        about the dating of agricultural terraces in previous years, the issue of dating them back to
                        ancient years remains an existent question for some scholars. Nevertheless, the sites mentioned
                        here offer fairly good evidence for a dating in the fifth or fourth centuries BC. Furthermore,
                        all these cases seem to share a common factor: their construction results from or is related to
                        demographic criteria, such as the population growth of every area.

                    <jats:p>A large number of lakes, lagoons, deltas, wetlands and flood plains converge in Andalusia.
                        The analysis of lake and marsh areas during Roman times has been a historical subject
                        insufficiently considered so far by Spanish historiographers. This research aims to undertake
                        the study of those more significant cases of High Guadalquivir (Jaén), always within the Roman
                        Baetica context. Focusing on the interaction among culture and environment, landscape ecology
                        and socio-natural systems, the authors aim to comprehend the relation of rural settlements to
                        these environments to study various methods of exploiting lagoon areas and to analyse lacustrine
                        landscapes in the historical context of the Roman period.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The paper concerns a research project carried out since 2011 by the Department of Sciences
                        on the Antiquity of the University of Messina and the Institute for Archaeological and
                        Monumental Heritage of the Italian National Research Council. The project is aimed at the
                        reconstruction of the ancient topography of the territory of the modern village of Rodì-Milici,
                        in the Province of Messina. The first campaign of systematic archaeological and topographical
                        surveys, using a differential GPS system and a Laser Scanner, were performed in the hills to the
                        west and south-west of the two villages, in particular on the large plateau between Monte
                        Ciappa, to the north, and Pizzo Cocuzza, to the south. The investigated area was identified by
                        L. Bernabò Brea, at the beginning of the 1950s, with the site of the ancient city of Longane. It
                        had a strategic location for the control of the valleys of the Patrì and Mazzarrà rivers
                        (respectively to the east and west of the investigated area) which constituted important routes
                        of connection and traffic between the Tyrrhenian coast, the Monti Peloritani area and the Ionian
                        coast of Sicily. The recent research, in integration with previous studies, acquired new data
                        about the Archaic settlement that had an organisation strictly integrated to the topographical
                        context and a structure different from traditional Greek colonies. The settlement on the plateau
                        did not have a regular plan but seems organised into quite well distinguished inhabited,
                        productive and sacred areas, while other areas are free of structures. It was protected by the
                        two fortified hills (Monte Ciappa and Pizzo Cocuzza) which controlled the natural entrances to
                        the plateau from north and south; the necropolises were located to the north-east and south of
                        these hills, along the principal ways to arrive to the settlement.

                    <jats:p>The contribution presents a summary of the methodology and preliminary results of the
                        research project Finziade and Lower Valley of Southern Himera of the Department of Ancient and
                        Modern Civilisations, University of Messina. The goal of this project was to reconstruct how the
                        territory of Licata (AG) on the southern coast of Sicily was settled. The area is of significant
                        importance in the process of colonisation of the island since it is at the mouth of the main
                        river. Monte Sant’Angelo, where the Hellenistic city of Finziade was found, was the subject of
                        systematic investigations and monographic studies by the University of Messina. A recent
                        analysis (2010-2012) of the so-called “Mountain”, the range of hills around Finziade, was the
                        subject of a doctoral project (in press) that presented a detailed representation of the area’s
                        settlement dynamic from prehistory to Late Antiquity. In 2012, on the basis of the new research,
                        it was decided to expand the framework of the investigation by analysing the vast plains and the
                        hills surrounding the “Mountain”. This research allows us to make the first historic assessment
                        and settlement models, both relating to the period before the foundation of Finziade (282 BC)
                        and for the later periods. The greatest population density is recorded in the “Castellucciana
                        Age”, in the first half of the second millennium BC and later, after the foundation of
                        Agrigento, with numerous nuclei of a non-urban nature, and in the early Hellenistic period with
                        numerous rural and military settlements, among which emerge the two fortified towns of Monte
                        Sole and Poggio Marcato d’Agnone. Important is the finding of several new areas containing clay
                        fragments of the Imperial Era and Late Antiquity, probably due to rural villages or production
                        centres. These villages, probably following a long tradition, exploited the fertile soil and
                        used the port at the mouth of the Himera River, as remembered in the land and sea routes from
                        the Late Roman period.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Rome’s contemporary city-structure in municipalities incorporated into the modern suburbs
                        those boundary areas that in ancient times spread from the city walls (i.e. the urbanised city)
                        towards the territory, forming a transit zone between city and country. The present paper
                        intends to highlight the significance of these areas, main indicators not only from a
                        historic-archaeological point of view, with respect to the knowledge of the ancient settlement’s
                        distribution and evolution within the territory, but especially with regards to the modern
                        landscape’s transformation, becoming pivotal areas that urbanists and town planners should take
                        into consideration for conservation and usage. Our study analyses the territory of Rome’s
                        Municipio XIII EST. This area shows a landscape that underwent a radical transformation
                        throughout centuries, due to the changed requirements of the different social realities that
                        followed each other from ancient Roman times until today. This casestudy shows clearly how the
                        strong urbanistic expansion that started strongly in the 1960s extended like wild fire from the
                        city centre towards the outside, becoming a rural landscape characterised by small properties
                        and vast rural estates, on a surface with high housing industry. This caused the obliteration of
                        the ancient landscape order, directly absorbed into the city and covered under many cement
                        layers, without even verifying the historical value in previous forms of rural settlement. The
                        widespread use of new technologies and territorial informative systems, like SITAR, Sistema
                        Informativo Territoriale Archeologico di Roma of the Soprintendenza Speciale per il Colosseo, il
                        Museo Nazionale Romano e l’Area Centrale di Roma, allows us to put together in a more rapid and
                        complete way all the information from the various sources (historical cartographies, archives
                        and bibliographic research, archaeological exploration of material data) and enables the
                        knowledge and reconstruction of historical contexts.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This paper presents the research method applied to the Archaeological Map of Italy – Forma
                        Italiae project, comprising to date the Ager Venusinus project (completed) and the Ager
                        Lucerinus project (ongoing). The methodology of the project is based on the extensive and
                        systematic survey of the entire selected district. The countryside is systematically searched by
                        groups of students and researchers in different seasons, time of the day, weather and visibility
                        conditions, and status of cultivation of the ground. The GPS georeferenced data are integrated
                        in a GIS specifically realised. The results of the research projects relating to the territory
                        of the Luceria’s colony, in Apulia, starting from the area of the medieval site of Montecorvino,
                        in the Daunian district is presented. So far the part of the vast territory of Lucera studied
                        concerns the area North-East of the ancient Latin colony. Discussed here are studies conducted
                        on the western area, towards the Daunian subappennine and in particular focused on the territory
                        of the municipalities of Lucera, Pietramontecorvino, Motta Montecorvino, and Volturino. This
                        area, in fact, is the object of research that includes the whole of the Fortore River valley.
                        The data emerging from recent surveys show a large population over the time-span from prehistory
                        to the High Middle Ages. The settlements of the Neolithic and Bronze ages, so far identified,
                        are placed on vast plains; on the northern sector of the territory, it is possible to catch a
                        glimpse of traces of a village characterised by the typical C shaped ditch, with huts located
                        inside. A very interesting part of our project regards Dauni and Samnite settlements in the
                        period preceding the arrival of the Romans and the Romanisation of the area. The most notable
                        transformations in the ancient landscape were undoubtedly produced by the Roman intervention
                        that gave birth to the new colony and the planning of the village centre, which consequently led
                        to the reorganisation of a vast territory and the division of the rural area into a dense
                        network of small properties assigned to the settlers.

                    <jats:p>The data presented are the preliminary results of the interdisciplinary project FIRB named
                        Landscape archaeology of the Adriatic “Puglia” in the Roman Age: innovative technologies for
                        sustainable planning and knowledge of cultural identity, carried out since 2013 by the
                        University of Molise (with a leading role), the University of Bari and the Politecnico of Bari.
                        The project deals with the old landscape of Egnazia through a global approach, underlining the
                        role of settlement dynamics, exploitation of natural resources, manufacturing activities and
                        trading and cultural exchanges within the Mediterranean basin. For the first time this
                        topographic research has allowed a systematic review of the territory through a complete survey
                        of the surface, mostly unknown before. The results of the survey are connected with the
                        information about the old town, largely explored thanks to the Project Egnazia: from Digging to
                        Evaluation directed by Raffaella Cassano since 2001. The analysis of the data, referring both to
                        the town and the territory, allows the identification of a strong settling structure, which is
                        subjected to many transformations from the Bronze Age till Late Antiquity. Only a single feature
                        is always visible during the whole ancient history of this place: the settlement was deeply
                        affected by the viability and the distribution of the “lame” (landform smaller than a ravine),
                        deep furrows in the natural stony bedrock used as water tanks and a link road between the hills
                        and the Adriatic Sea.

                    <jats:p>The present remarks derive from on-going topographic-archaeological projects focusing on
                        North coastal Etruria and South Picenum. These studies apply a global archaeology approach that
                        includes diachronic and interdisciplinary research. In our projects particular attention is
                        being paid to palaeogeographic aspects. Processual methodology standards are applied to our
                        research; nevertheless, geomorphologic, spatial and quantitative evidence is integrated with
                        qualitative and symbolic data to reconstruct all the anthropic activities. Some remarks will be
                        made about the informative potential of ploughsoil findings, landscape complexity, strategies in
                        collecting and studying pottery and on the importance of considering the absence of particular
                        categories of materials. Following this global approach and its consequential theoretical
                        framework and rigorous methodology, archaeologists will be able to take up the interpretative
                        challenge of defining landscapes in terms of their different components: sites, off-sites and
                        their historical-functional classification. Obviously, the objective and subjective standards
                        used for these classifications have to be explained clearly, so that the research results of a
                        district can be used for comparisons and large-scale analyses.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The Laboratory of Ancient Topography and Photogrammetry (LabTAF) at the University of
                        Salento has long been engaged in the study of the ancient landscape, essentially through
                        intensive field survey, the analysis of vertical and oblique multi-temporal aerial photographs
                        and the development of a GIS system devoted to archaeological documentation. This integrated
                        system of knowledge supports two main goals: sophisticated elaboration of complex datasets and
                        practical possibilities for preservation of the archaeological heritage by providing efficient
                        tools to the management of the territory and its cultural components. This contribution presents
                        an analytic study of a sample area, chosen for its geomorphological characteristics and for its
                        cultural complexity. This territory lies in the southern part of the Apulia Region, located
                        between Lecce, the ancient Roman Lupiae, and its seaport at San Cataldo, along the Adriatic
                        coast, covering about 85 km2 circa. Analysis of data from the field archaeological surveys,
                        analysis of aerial photographs, archaeological aerial-survey and excavations revealed that the
                        full functionality of the ancient harbour required the inland presence of a productive and
                        receptive territory, with the distribution of rural settlements closely connected with the coast
                        and the road system. The research presents an excellent opportunity for testing the potential of
                        GIS systems in combination with conventional methodologies for landscape analysis,
                        archaeological excavations and the application of new technologies.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This survey focuses on the situation of the landscape and the ancient settlement of
                        Lilybaeum in the countryside behind the modern centre of Mazara del Vallo. Based on the survey,
                        the knowledge of the archaeological sites was applied to create an overview of the settlement
                        dynamics in the territory. Evidence points to a widespread settlement, developed approximately
                        from the end of the fourth century BC but established in the second century BC. It was linked
                        mainly to the available water and environmental resources, especially agriculture, pastoralism,
                        the quarries, the Mazaro River and to the easy possibility of trade, especially with North
                        Africa. What stands out the most is the organisation of the settlements: it was possible to
                        identify both large settlements and sometimes veritable villages, extending over several
                        hectares, in this case similar to what has been found in other Sicilian districts, and to
                        identify minor sites, probably functional to the villae or villages. The surface of a site in
                        the San Miceli area, located near the banks of the Mazaro River, behind the port on the estuary
                        of Mazara is exceptional. It has a very wide extension compared to other sites. Some of these
                        sites, with remarkable signs of growth in the Late Imperial Age, especially in the fourth-fifth
                        centuries AD, do not seem to survive beyond the sixth-seventh centuries AD. In a few cases we
                        witness a continuum in the settlement, albeit in different forms compared to the previous
                        periods, almost until the eleventh century AD in sites tied to the presence of wells, mills and,
                        presumably, a road network. It was possible to redact an archaeological map from the
                        archaeological data collected in the territory.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The special position occupied in prehistoric research by the proto-urban centre of Verucchio
                        in southern Romagna can be explained not only in the extraordinary finds that have been made in
                        its necropolis but also in its position as an Etruscan bridgehead in Umbrian territory. However,
                        the history of the origins of the settlement and its zone of influence are largely unexplored.
                        The project Verucchio: City Development and Trade Links, Eleventh-Seventh Century BC, supported
                        by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), aims to address this desideratum at various levels such as
                        survey, settlement patterns, trade routes and raw material supply. Research focuses on the areas
                        directly adjacent to the valley of the river Marecchia, the main trade route between the
                        Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic coast in this area. Between 2009 and 2013 an archaeological
                        landscape survey was successfully carried out and will be completed in 2015. Particular
                        attention is being paid to topographically favoured hilltops and plateaus. In most of these
                        locations archaeological remains with varying degrees of clarity can be identified through
                        systematic site inspections. During the previous five survey campaigns more than 200 sites
                        dating from the Stone Age to the Roman Imperial Age have been located. This preliminary paper
                        aims to give an overview of the most important known and some of the newly discovered
                        archaeological sites in the Marecchia Valley.

                    <jats:p>This study focuses on the analysis of the landscape in the territory of the colony of
                        Himera. In particular, this work is inspired by a detailed examination conducted on the basis of
                        parametric modelling, which has helped us to understand what factors (pedology, altimetry,
                        geology, supply basins, etc.) had an effect in the settlement choices of the Imerese territory
                        during the Colonial Age. We analysed the role intervisibility had between sites in the
                        organisation of the landscape. By avoiding a deterministic logic, we intersected the data from
                        previous surveys on the development of predictive models with the archaeological data,
                        formulating hypotheses on the role that the main settlements in the area had on the control and
                        economic management of the territory.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This study presents the results of topographic research on the Salento territory with a
                        particular focus on the coast. The distribution of the coastal settlements, especially in
                        prehistoric times, developed with a continuous chain of settlements, placed almost regularly
                        along the Salento coast. The study of the aerophotographic documents has allowed the
                        identification of large traces from residual moisture that would suggest the existence of some
                        marsh basins, which would place certain settlements in one location, extremely isolated and
                        protected, between sea and river. These conditions widely occur in both Salento coasts. In a few
                        cases the same conditions can also be found in hinterland settlements where there are humid
                        areas or seasonal wetlands. It seems clear that the archaeological sites of considerable size,
                        milestone studies of traditional Italian prehistoric research (such as Scoglio del Tonno,
                        Saturo, Torre Castelluccia, etc.), are characterised by the presence of a significant quantity
                        of imported Aegean pottery and fortification works that often require great commitment and
                        consistency. They alternate with minor settlements, sometimes equipped with fortifications as in
                        the case of Bagnara, Torre Castiglione or Porto Badisco. A varied landscape also includes the
                        large port facilities such as Brindisi, Taranto and Otranto, small landings, production sites
                        and settlements of “purpurarii” (settlements dedicated to the extraction of purple pigment from
                        gastropod molluscs). The preliminary results show complex situations, often not detected during
                        the excavation work of the past, which may be better understood with systematic and extensive
                        archaeological investigations, as is clear in the extraordinary evidence of the on going
                        research in Rocavecchia.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This paper is focused on the territories of San Lorenzello, Guardia Sanframondi and Cerreto
                        Sannita (district of Benevento, Campania), in the eastern area of the Ager Telesinus, along the
                        route to the Apennines mountains through the Volturno, Titerno and Calore valleys. The research
                        is related to the Project of the Archaeological Map of the Northern Campania, coordinated by S.
                        Quilici Gigli. This territory has important archaeological risk, as archaeological records
                        testify, including hill-forts with polygonal walls, the town of Telesia, the necropoleis and the
                        ruins of the villae in the suburbium. The current expansion of the survey to both the eastern
                        and western sectors offers a larger point of view to analyse wide-ranging topics such as the
                        pre-Roman settlement and the interregional roads. New data are emerging on the prehistoric and
                        protohistoric ages in the territory of Guardia Sanframondi, in the wide alluvial area closest to
                        the Calore River. In the territory of San Lorenzello and Cerreto Sannita, new data was been
                        collected by the author on a settlement of the pre-Roman times in the zones overlooking the
                        Titerno valley. Studies and surveys in this area have had operating implications. Maps of
                        archaeological risk, based on the archaeological map of the Ager Telesinus, were produced,
                        thanks to collaboration between the University, Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici and the
                        local Government, with the goal of creating a common strategy for land-use planning.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In the Ager Faliscus, recent systematic surveys nearby the stream Fosso di Fustignano have
                        revealed a complex system of landscape management in Antiquity, recorded by the inscription CIL
                        XI 7505, speaking about grazing lands (prata) in the Republican Age. The system has been
                        described by A. Pasqui and partially positioned by S. Quilici Gigli. Recent explorations have
                        allowed the location once again of the inscription nearby via Amerina and the discovery of a
                        series of archaeological elements allowing the reconstruction of a complex system of
                        organisation of the agricultural landscape strictly linked to the main viability. A well-turned
                        structure of irrigation and drainage of the acreages proximal to the stream composed the work of
                        C. Egnatius recorded in the epigraphy. Two different engineering solutions have been used,
                        founded on the payload of the stream. Where the flow rate was minor, narrow rocky drains were
                        realised to limit the range of the bed, to increase the level of the river and to permit the
                        irrigation of the surrounding lands by a series of locks. The inscription of C. Egnatius is
                        located just in front of one of these channels. Downstream, the irrigation system became more
                        complex, using powerful dams. Outside one of these channels another inscription (Pr(ivatus?)
                        Elix / Hic [-] VX [---]) may be concerned with the end of the water system and, at the same
                        time, advises on the beginning of the area designated as private property. This interpretation
                        corroborates the theory (already supported by aerophotointerpretation) of the presence of rural
                        divisions in this area. The regular grid has an eight actus modulus and via Amerina constitutes
                        the kardo. Then the work of C. Egnatius is simultaneous and inside the rural reorganisation of
                        the Faliscan landscape in the aftermath of the Roman occupation.

                    <jats:p>This paper summarises data gathered from an inter-regional research project conducted
                        through land surveys, stratigraphic studies and the stratigraphic analysis of upstanding
                        structures, within a program of the Department of Medieval Archaeology at the University of
                        Urbino “Carlo Bo”. Surveys were carried out in the valley of the Marecchia River, Italy. The
                        river flows through two regions, Emilia-Romagna and Marche, and two provinces, Rimini and
                        Pesaro-Urbino. The project, which began in 2006, aims at presenting a diachronic landscape
                        reconstruction by analysing landscapes transformation processes, from the Roman Age to the
                        Renaissance. Special attention is devoted to the Middle Ages, the phenomenon of encastellation
                        and to historical buildings. Within the project, extremely important, especially for the Middle
                        Ages, are the surveys, carried out for the past 14 years at the archaeological site of the
                        Castle of Monte Copiolo, hometown of the Counts of Montefeltro, who would later become Dukes of
                        Urbino.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This work aims to present a research project on the landscapes of the ancient Appian Way in
                        the area east of Benevento. The project, sponsored by the Soprintendenza Archeologica in
                        collaboration with the University of Salerno, was born from the desire to deal, in an organic
                        way, with the topographic reconstruction of the Appian roadway through a wider project of
                        reconstruction of ancient landscapes. The Appian route, from Benevento, has been debated by
                        various scholars who have provided several hypotheses. In particular, the road out of the city,
                        headed east to Aeclanum. Its route to Ponte Rotto on the Calore River has not been identified
                        yet and the studies carried out up to now are not certain of its topographical identification.
                        What is known is that there had to be, just outside of the city, a statio, Nucriola or
                        Nuceriola, located on the fourth mile, and the next ad Calorem, which probably was on the site
                        of Ponte Rotto. The project Ancient Appia Landscapes wants to test the signs on the ground, the
                        archaeological traces that these assumptions produced, trying to reconstruct not only the layout
                        of the road, but also in a broader context, where the ancient settlement dynamics can be valued
                        as a whole not as just an individual monument or road stretch. In this perspective, the research
                        covers various methods and tools of investigation (the study of archives, historical maps,
                        paleobotanical analysis, surface surveys, aerial photography interpretation, geomorphological
                        surveys). Since 2010, a fieldwork characterised by systematic and thematic survey of particular
                        sites started: while the surveys for particular sites allowed the retrieval of archaeological,
                        monumental and accurate information in the area east of Benevento, the systematic surveys
                        proposed the implementation of transects based on the geomorphological characteristics of the
                        area. Since July 2011, a first campaign of thematic research concerning one of the assumptions
                        of the reconstruction of the road network proposed in the early ’900 by Meomartini started.
                        Intensive surveys provided the division of the territory in reconnaissance units measured on the
                        morphology, on the surface visibility and on the division of land. From the first analysis of
                        the context of findings accurate and aerial data emerged allowing to propose a topographical
                        reconstruction of the route of the Consular way in a large and articulated settlement system.

                    <jats:p>The paper concerns three research projects promoted during the last 20 years by the
                        University of Tuscia, aimed at the reconstruction of the ancient topography of areas inside
                        southern Etruria, between Viterbo and the Tiber river valley; they are based on the systematic
                        exploration of the territory and the production of archaeological maps. Two of these works,
                        regarding the Ager Ciminius and Bomarzo-Bassano-Mugnano areas were completed and published in
                        the series Carta Archeologica d’Italia - Contributi; the title of the series relates to the
                        first project in the archaeological mapping of the national territory, performed in the last
                        decades of the nineteenth century. The third research project, still in progress, regards the
                        territory surrounding Viterbo, and between the city itself and the ancient settlement of Ferento
                        and Acquarossa. The research projects produced archaeological maps aimed at supporting both the
                        reconstruction of historical processes in a diachronic perspective and the activities in
                        preservation of the archaeological heritage conducted by the Soprintendenza Archeologica per
                        l’Etruria Meridionale. The systematic research activities allowed the collection of many new
                        data about the ancient topography of these areas from the Proto-historic Age to the Medieval
                        period, across the Etruscan and Roman epochs. The settlement pattern, the necropolises, the road
                        networks, the rural and productive activities were studied and reconstructed. In general, the
                        new data are very numerous in comparison to those previously known. Moreover, field-walking also
                        provided the opportunity to document the condition of preservation of the archaeological
                        evidence. In particular, in the area surrounding Viterbo, many ancient remains damaged or
                        destroyed by new urbanisation and infrastructures are documented (also in comparison to the data
                        documented during the surveys performed in the same territory at the beginning of 1970s). In the
                        other two study areas, the most numerous damages are produced by mechanised agricultural works.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>For over twenty years, the Università degli Studi della Tuscia has carried out and
                        coordinated surveys in Southern Etruria, today’s province of Viterbo. These investigations are
                        performed with traditional methods (collection of all kinds of data and their analysis,
                        systematic field-walking and so on) combined with the employment of the latest technological
                        applications. The area covered by these surveys is very wide (from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the
                        Tiber River) and equally wide is the span of the connected studies, ranging from prehistoric to
                        post-medieval periods. The deep geo-morphological diversities of this region have influenced, in
                        the course of time, the occupation of the territory, its exploitation and settlement patterns.
                        This research project has been partially motivated by the intention to fill a gap in our
                        knowledge of a region which is very close to Rome and which has not been thoroughly examined
                        until recently. The aim of this work is not only to redo a “census” of all the archaeological
                        evidence of the territory but also to provide analysis according to coherent chronological
                        phases or to specific topics (road-systems, distribution and typology of settlements, human
                        activities and so on). A part of the data collected so far has been published in monographs by

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Topographical studies in the last decades have greatly improved our knowledge of Roman
                        Panormus (modern day Palermo) but many aspects of its urban planning still remain obscure. It is
                        very hard work to clearly understand a city that has been continuously inhabited from at least
                        the Iron Age to the present. This long standing existence implies countless transformations of
                        its urban aspect. In particular the Arab domination, in the Middle Ages, erased even the memory
                        of the ancient place names, so the toponomastic source that is often a fundamental tool for the
                        ancient topographer is almost useless. Using the typical sources of ancient topography and
                        landscape archaeology and its multidisciplinary approach can be exceedingly useful in
                        understanding the ancient aspect of a living city. We found an important lack of information
                        about ancient Palermo: the location of buildings designed for public spectacles. The epigraphic
                        sources prove that in Palermo there was a theatre and an amphitheatre; from a Late-Antique
                        source we can assume that there was also a circus. This paper’s aim is to suggest concrete
                        hypotheses to identify the locations of all three of these buildings, discuss their position and
                        their relation to the civic plan of Panormus. These results are important in understanding this
                        city in a more complete way but also for the protection of its archaeological heritage: these
                        three areas lie outside the ancient walls of Palermo and have hitherto been considered “low-risk
                        areas” for archaeology. manifestations

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In this paper we present the geoarchaeological and landscape project on the Upper Agri
                        Valley (Basilicata). Between 2012 and 2015 we coordinated multidisciplinary research with the
                        purpose of reconstructing the history and evolution of the territory, analysing the
                        relationships between man and landscape from the Prehistory to the Middle Age. The studied area,
                        an inland mountain valley situated in the ancient Lucania, is very important, because it is a
                        fundamental route between the two coasts of Magna Graecia and because during the Roman period
                        this valley was the territory in which Grumentum was born, one of the most important towns of
                        Roman Southern Italy. Thanks to the dialogue between different competences, this project aims at
                        understanding the settlements dynamics and the mutual influences between man and environment:
                        indeed, we conducted geophysics and geoarchaeological investigations, archaeological surveys,
                        cartographic and aerial photos studies, written sources analysis: in this way, different data
                        are used to understand the landscape from a global point of view.

                    <jats:p>“Knowledge” of all kinds of evidence is important for scientists and researchers but it is
                        also necessary for the protection and development of territory. It is, at the same time, the
                        requisite basis for the right management of the territory and correct planning as it is also
                        support for competent territorial administrations. This paper describes how the Italian National
                        GIS for Cultural Heritage collects, records and presents archaeological and environmental data
                        from several Regions for use in planning and other management regimes.

                        archives, bibliography, local bibliography and oral information, give an interesting picture of
                        population settlement patterns in the Region of Abruzzo. Since prehistoric periods, the area
                        along the Royal Sheep Track (Tratturo Regio) has been controlled by hilltop settlements as an
                        ancient commercial route. The settlement pattern, on a local scale, still survives today.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The increasing sophistication and complexity of archaeological models has precluded easy
                        testing of such models, and oftentimes requires assessments that can be as lengthy and
                        complicated as the initial model design and execution. Here, a multi-criteria decision-based
                        model developed to simulate hunter-gatherer land use decisions in the Post-Glacial Netherlands
                        is discussed. To approximate when and where uncertainty occurs, a sensitivity analysis is
                        implemented that involves varying input parameter weights to determine those parameters with the
                        greatest potential impact on model output. This process incorporates linked combinations of
                        statistical and qualitative tests that are unique to each stage of the modeling. While the
                        sensitivity analysis described allows modellers to become better acquainted with both their
                        models and data – and the inherent limitations that lie therein – the utility of such a
                        heuristic exercise is debatable. Thus, another approach is proposed that involves running two
                        spatial analyses that target the same question of human land use decision-making from different
                        directions and harnessing different data. This procedure has the ability to provide
                        archaeological modellers with a better approximation of the robustness of each spatial analysis,
                        especially when the two analyses converge upon similar answers. When the spatial analyses do not
                        produce similarly patterned results, we know it is time to go “back to the drawing board” and
                        reassess the meta-issue of whether the questions we are asking can be answered via our modeling
                        abstractions. These issues are of no small import because if archaeological models are to
                        resonate with researchers conducting similar simulative and decision-based models in other
                        fields, then we must implement comparable post-process tests on our models too.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This study forms part of a larger project analysing the development of the cultural
                        landscape in the Dutch Roman limes region, including the development of the rural economy. The
                        primary research aim in this study is to investigate changes in pastoral production as a result
                        of differing population dynamics of sheep and cattle herds subjected to different animal
                        husbandry practices. Differences between such practices have not been considered in previous
                        models of pastoral production in the region where herds have been treated as static entities. In
                        this study we simulated different animal husbandry strategies based on trends and developments
                        inferred from the faunal record in a well-documented area of the limes zone. The results of
                        these simulations were analysed for differences in population viability, as well as relative
                        differences in production of meat, wool and manure, and relative requirements for pastureland
                        requirements and labour. Our analysis shows that cattle and sheep herds exploited for products
                        supplied by the animals whilst living (manure and traction from cattle, wool from sheep) exhibit
                        higher growth rates than herds exploited for meat. In addition, they are able to supply larger
                        quantities of calories. However these herds have higher requirements for labour and land,
                        presenting a possibly limiting factor. We conclude that, in addition to complementing
                        intensification and extensification of arable farming observed in the region, agriculturalists
                        would have benefitted from herds with higher growth rates, particularly given their
                        risk-aversion behavior during periods of economic uncertainty. These simulations will be
                        subsequently used to produce more nuanced scenarios of pastoral production within agent-based
                        modelling of the mixed rural economy in the Dutch Roman limes zone.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This paper describes a method to calculate a “land use heritage map” based on the concept of
                        “memory of landscape”. Such a map can be seen as one variable among many others that can
                        influence site location preference and can be used as input for archaeological predictive
                        models. The computed values equate to an index of long-term land use intensity. This index aims
                        to assess the influence of previous occupation of the landscape on settlement location, in
                        particular Roman rural settlements. The method was applied on a micro-region located in Southern
                        France in order to test its workability. It is concluded that the method is potentially suitable
                        for incorporating the influence of previous occupation in predictive modelling but still needs
                        further refinement in order to be more generally applicable.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In this research locations are selected in Southern Flevoland (Central Netherlands) which
                        are most likely to contain archaeological remains dating to the Younger Dryas (YD)
                        (12,900-11,700 cal BP). To map and determine these locations two steps are performed: 1) The
                        Pleistocene surface of Southern Flevoland is classified into landforms using a GIS application
                        based on Topographic Position Index.2) Data on the geomorphological setting and the distance to
                        the nearest freshwater source of well-dated YD archaeological sites in the Northwest European
                        Plain are extrapolated to the study area. The inductive predictive model indicates that elevated
                        areas in close proximity to a freshwater source have the highest probability to contain YD
                        archaeological remains. For potential Federmesser remains a maximum distance of 1500 m from the
                        Eem fluvial system is estimated and for potential Ahrensburgian remains a maximum distance of
                        2500 metres. The areas with potential YD archaeological remains constitute less than 10% of the
                        total study area. The detailed and well-preserved Pleistocene surface in the study area,
                        combined with potentially well-preserved YD remains due to the Holocene sediment cover, is of
                        major importance for future studies on landscape exploitation by prehistoric hunter – fisher –
                        gatherers. Reconstructing landscape exploitation opens up new avenues to study subsistence
                        economy, settlement patterns and spatial organisation of past societies.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>In this paper we present the first results of a study that aims to better understand and
                        model the size and development of population in the Dutch Roman limes zone, as part of a larger
                        research project investigating the development of the cultural landscape in the area. Earlier
                        estimates of population size have only used general assumptions based on settlement density and
                        supposed Roman army recruitment requirements and have not considered in any detail the factors
                        influencing population growth and decline. This paper first presents the existing evidence for
                        estimating population size in the area and then discusses the evidence for mortality and
                        fertility estimates in the Roman period, necessary to better understand the large-scale
                        demographic processes involved. From this evidence, new estimates for population size in the
                        Early and Middle Roman period are calculated, using agent-based modelling to better understand
                        the dynamics of population growth and the effects of recruitment of soldiers by the Roman army.
                        It is concluded that earlier calculations underestimated the potential for population growth as
                        well as the effect of forced recruitment on demography.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Landscape archaeology is a broad field that seeks to place what we consider “archaeological”
                        into a spatial context, whether that be literal, theoretical, or conceptual. With more recent
                        approaches to social-spatial simulation (through GIS or agent-based modelling techniques) this
                        has entailed complex mathematical methods or procedures which can be quite difficult to evaluate
                        or even understand as a representation of past human activity. It could be said that
                        archaeological remains often drive the construction of the simulation, or conversely that social
                        complexity is expected to organically emerge from simple programmed “rules” of behaviour in a
                        frictionless or highly generalised manifold. Naturally, the result has been models that have
                        been dismissed as missing the point, or being too simplistic to be of any use because they
                        neither consider past people’s cognitive intentions nor the material remains that have been
                        eradicated by taphonomic processes. Perhaps we need to redefine what it is that interests us as
                        archaeologists. Is it finding sites, features and artefacts? Or is it understanding past human
                        behaviour in the context of objective-oriented mechanisms, preferably within a spatial
                        framework? If it is the latter, then maybe we need to look at modelling human energetics as both
                        a past “spatial currency” and as a primary unit of analysis. Sites, artefacts and features are
                        by-products in the human expression of energy across the landscape, and they should be defined
                        and used as such in understanding and evaluating complex spatial models. A large-scale GIS
                        simulation of the first century BC Helvetian subsistence economy (an on-going project) is used
                        to illustrate these ideas.

                    <jats:p>This paper explains the genesis of the Seeing heritage through the lenses of landscape
                        session organised at the LAC 2014 conference by the CHeriScape network. It introduces seven
                        papers presented at the conferences (and summarises three others), contextualising them in the
                        symbiotic relationship between landscape and heritage within modern European society, and draws
                        from them, under the general themes used in the CHeriScape network, a series of common threads
                        and conclusions that contribute to CHeriScape’s agenda. The discourse is located within the
                        frame of three recent European policy documents, the European Landscape Convention, the Faro
                        Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society and the ESF/COST Science Policy
                        Briefing on landscape. The conclusions form part of the process of increasing the social
                        relevance of landscape archaeology and its potential contribution to the grand challenges
                        commonly identified in current policy-making debates.

                    <jats:p>The Italian Archaeological Mission in Iraqi Kurdistan (MAIKI) of the Sapienza University of
                        Rome aims to study the archaeological, historical, linguistic and cultural development of the
                        Kurdish region through a wide historical period. MAIKI started by focusing on the archaeological
                        and philological analysis of the Sasanian site of Paikuli. In recent years, however,
                        investigation has been expanded to include an accurate survey of the area between the Dyala and
                        Basara rivers, around the main road that connects the city of Chamchamal to Darbandikhan, in
                        order to implement a complete and updated archaeological map of the entire territory. The
                        continuing work includes a preparatory study of the few bibliographical records available and an
                        overall analysis of the accessible, current and historical satellite imagery in order to obtain
                        a reliable context for the results of archaeological field surveys. During the field campaigns,
                        which are currently suspended because of the political instability and war in the region,
                        archaeological material was collected in all the visited sites and a detailed morphological and
                        archaeometric study was set up. A complete map of the currently inhabited villages of the area
                        has been compiled because up-to-date base cartography of the area did not exist; this new map
                        has proved to be useful not only for locating archaeological records but also for the activities
                        of the ethnological research that joined the Mission in 2013. The area suffered very much during
                        Saddam Hussein’s Al-Anfal campaign when all of the people were forced to leave. The ethnological
                        study will help to reveal the impact that these recent traumatic events have had on the
                        preservation of the cultural heritage whilst supplying rich documentation for further
                        investigation, including on relationship between man and territory, local economy, migration
                        policies and religious practices.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The Prehistoric Ethnographic National Museum “Luigi Pigorini” holds one of Europe’s most
                        important collections of prehistoric archaeological material with contexts excavated beginning
                        at the end of the nineteenth century. This paper illustrates the first steps towards a digitised
                        model of the archives and of the Museum collection with the aim of refreshing the Museum’s
                        memory by restoring lost connections between the landscape context and the historical documents
                        of archaeological research (including old photographs, registers, notes and sketches). The
                        methodological approach begins with the experience of the project SITAR, the web-based GIS of
                        the Superintendence for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome. It intends to develop
                        geographically-focused solutions to share the knowledge of the Museum with local communities and
                        to highlight the connections between prehistoric finds and the current landscape, thus
                        contributing to the formation of the community’s identity. This process intends to move the
                        Museum towards a dynamic dimension and make it more accessible and meaningful for contemporary
                        users.

                    <jats:p>This paper briefly shows the use of an analysis of a large number of IGM 1930 glass slide
                        negatives and an accurate photo-interpretation of cropmarks to create a particular view of the
                        territory of ancient Caere, almost 30 km NW of Rome. This territory was covered by a great
                        number of tumuli and tombs of different kind, giving a very strong and impressive sensation of
                        power and wealth. Topographical analysis of the case study area by direct survey, field-checking
                        and revision of previous data and pertinent documentation (bibliographic, public and private
                        archives and information in loco, etc.) was accompanied by examination and analysis of
                        historical and recent aerial photographs from different archives, with additional monitoring
                        flights over areas of risk. The aim was to obtain an historical perspective of the territory to
                        help the protection of cultural heritage remains, meet the need for the establishment of a
                        global Cultural Heritage cadastre connected to studies for legal protection and enjoyment of
                        great interest sites, and finally, not least, for a correct territorial planning.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>Long considered by many historians as an “internal colony” (Haynes, 1997), the cultural
                        landscape of the coalfields of McDowell County, southern West Virginia (USA) displays a
                        palimpsest of political, social, cultural and environmental history. Drawing out some of the
                        most valuable coal in the world, Pocahontas “smokeless” (McGehee, 2012), the grip of absentee
                        landholders (Myers, 2008) on the region is reflected in legible traces on the land.
                        Investigating remnant industrial terrain, modelled using LiDAR, brings patterns to the surface
                        for interpretation and typological analysis (Opitz, 2012). From early mining forms, wildcat and
                        prospect mines, to tunnel and later Mountain Top Removal (MTR), the morphology of the landscape
                        evolved in line with machine technology and reflects the history of place. Communities
                        constructed as work camps reveal an ordered geometry of control, a mnemonic of “corporate
                        paternalism” (Garay, 2011); while the buildings of Gary, West Virginia, a US Coal and Coke
                        Company model town evoke a Utopian efficiency and economy. Post-1950s boom time McDowell County
                        counted 100,000 residents with cluttered Main Streets and overflowing rail lines. Today the
                        population has dwindled to near 20,000 and the memory of early twentieth century industry in the
                        “Free State of McDowell” is fast being erased either through neglect, abandonment or conscious
                        elimination. MTR mining and the practice of filling valleys with waste rock obliterates
                        topography at an unprecedented scale. Abandoned camps are washed away from the floodplain or
                        intentionally removed. Smaller scale mining operations are swept away as new technologies raise
                        the economic viability of thin coal seams. As the landscapes, communities, and buildings of
                        McDowell County are reorganised and reshaped, a methodology for analysis through remote sensing
                        and ground-truthing (Doenus et al, 2008; Gallagher &amp; Josephs, 2008; Horne, 2009) informs
                        interpretive strategies in capturing narratives of place.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>This paper presents research on the historic urban settlement and natural landscape between
                        the Göreme and Kiliclar (Swords) valleys, located in Kapadokya, one of the most distinctive
                        human and natural landscapes in the world, inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985.
                        The research was part of the Italian Scientific Research Programs of Relevant National Interest
                        (PRIN) programme Rupestrian Art and Habitats in Kapadokya (Turkey) and in Central and Southern
                        Italy – Rock, Excavated Architecture, Painting: Between Knowledge, Preservation and Enhancement.
                        The study area has all the features of rupestrian Mediterranean culture, encompassing a heritage
                        developed over time with environmental, architectural and artistic elements. It tells a special
                        story about ancient life, completing and widening our comprehension of the past. There are
                        buildings of great architectural and pictorial qualities, such as the Tokali Kilise, Saint
                        Eustachius and Saint Daniel, where it is still possible to read the old defensive system and the
                        local way of life. Yet these cave settlements are at risk from deterioration. The research is
                        centred on survey, especially on a digital survey carried out using 3D laser scanners for the
                        architecture as well as of the natural stone structure of the settlement. In this way the first
                        complete and detailed documentation of this area has been created, allowing the first studies on
                        the urban character of this archaeological site. The research presented here will show a fully
                        digital approach using 3D digital models aimed to investigate, read, preserve the information
                        and disseminate the artistic and cultural values otherwise not easily accessible and
                        continuously at risk of loss because of decay processes.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>The dominant perceptual sense in western culture is certainly that of sight: the “vision” of
                        the world, even in everyday language, tends to coincide with what is perceived as reality. Not
                        surprisingly, our being in the world is increasingly defined from the perspective of a single
                        “point of view”. The first consequence is the progressive absorption of the multisensory
                        component, which inevitably characterises every act of perception, within the arrangements of an
                        ever more debased and impoverished image. Landscape is an interface consisting of objects,
                        situations and configurations that indicate precise locations of resources and meanings. Spatial
                        configurations that allow the identification of a resource or a meaning can be both structural
                        (such as a row of trees) and a type of energy (such as acoustic configurations or soundscape, or
                        the light intensity, e.g. light spots within of a forest, or olfactory, e.g. smelling traces
                        left by an animal). In this paper a case study is provided of some material contexts, examined
                        through the conceptual lens of “soundscape” applied to archaeology. The examination of the sound
                        components relates to pre-Roman Italy and involves the definition of “soundscape” as a subject
                        of archaeological research. Soundscape frequently denotes the natural sound environment through
                        its primary physical components such as the sounds of nature (wind, water, forests, birds,
                        insects, animals), but it is also produced by human activity, and the outcomes of phonic
                        instrumental artefacts and mechanical actions. The len is moved, therefore, from what is
                        observed to what is heard; as regards archaeological analysis, data is projected onto
                        culturally-contextualised acoustic scenery.

                <jats:abstract>
                    <jats:p>‘The personal is political’ is one of Kate Millet’s most famous phrases. It refers to the
                        mismatches between the needs of the citizenry and practices carried out by those in the
                        political sphere. In our case, we can relate this to integrated heritage management, and more
                        specifically, the policies implemented in recent years in rural contexts in Spain. This paper
                        examines the case of the large number of Heritage Interpretation Centres, restoration of
                        traditional structures, and archaeological excavations which were initiated from the 1990s by
                        rural municipalities, with funding from the European Union (Leader Funds, mainly), but many of
                        which a decade later have failed and been abandoned by public institutions. This paper argues
                        that this was partly due to the lack of public participation in the development of these
                        projects, which were managed vertically and asymmetrically, with the inhabitants of the towns
                        excluded and unable to contribute their own vision. Future heritage management projects should
                        be based on citizen participation and empowerment of the different local agents that are closer
                        to heritage sites. Through a case study in northern Cáceres, a revitalisation of the rural
                        northern Extremadura area is proposed based on sustainable heritage tourism and revolving around
                        three key concepts: cultural landscape, heritage and empowerment. For this to be implemented
                        successfully, we must deal with various characteristics which form the identity of the region,
                        as well as the particular political development within northern Extremadura.
