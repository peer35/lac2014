        <Abstract>In the context of searching for agricultural landscapes which have escaped recent anthropogenic
            disturbance, the evidence of the Kislovodsk basin (North Caucasus) has special importance. Its sheltered
            location and the fact that it is relatively well-studied, enable us to create, for the first time in Russia,
            an archaeological Geographic Information System (GIS) for the microregion, which currently includes data on
            over 920 archaeological sites, from the Aeneolithic to modern times. Preliminary analysis of the
            archaeological record of the Kislovodsk basin has revealed that the Early Medieval period dating to the
            fifth - eight centuries AD was characterised by the highest population density. The Site Catchment Analysis
            used in the framework of GIS revealed over 120 fortified and unfortified settlements of the early medieval
            Alanic tribes. The investigation consisted of several stages in the course of which potential ploughing
            areas were modelled for each settlement. It was based on the combined archaeological and soil field survey
            around fortified settlements in the different parts of the area. It appears that from the fifth to the
            eighth centuries AD relatively flat territories of 1 km round the site were the most valuable for
            agriculture. The rest of the economic area, simulated using Thiessen tessellation, could have been used for
            pasture and hay-making. Computer simulation of the potential economic territories gives the possibility to
            determine the area of proposed ploughing and pasture holdings and to estimate the quantity of settled
            population along with their cattle. As a result, a modelling thesis of a small dimension of the patronymic
            society of the Alans who occupied these early medieval settlements and the affirmation of self-sufficiency
            of their economy were confirmed.

        <Abstract>Questo contributo si propone di analizzare in maniera organica alcuni dati significativi, emersi
            combinando gli studi delle due autrici, in merito alle trasformazione dei modelli urbani e produttivi nella
            Cilicia Tracheia/Isauria nel periodo tardo romano e protobizantino. Da una prima analisi emerge un quadro
            della regione piuttosto complesso e articolato che vede un territorio ricco di centri urbani a cui si
            alternano aree rurali dedite alla produzione agricola e alla lavorazione delle materie prime e che
            attraversa in questo periodo (IV – metà VII secolo) una fase di evidente incremento dell’attività
            commerciale, proiettando le città della costa dell’Isauria nelle rotte mediterranee fino in Occidente. Un
            tale mutamento nell’assetto economico, però, non può prescindere da una crescita dell’attività produttiva
            che raggiunge una portata inedita e che si manifesta principalmente nella coltivazione della vite e
            dell’ulivo e nella commercializzazione di vino e olio. Dal punto di vista archeologico ciò si riscontra, per
            esempio, nella diffusione sul territorio extraurbano di impianti legati principalmente alla produzione di
            olio e vino e nella presenza considerevole, soprattutto in contesti cittadini, di fornaci per la
            fabbricazione di contenitori da trasporto: la produzione sembra non più volta a soddisfare il solo
            fabbisogno locale, ma razionalizzata in maniera tale da garantire un surplus di materie prime destinate al
            commercio. In questo contesto doveva essere fondamentale il sistema integrato aree rurali – città costiere,
            basato sulla produzione nelle prime e sulla commercializzazione delle merci nelle seconde, malgrado resti
            ancora di difficile comprensione il sistema amministrativo che doveva regolare i rapporti tra le due realtà.
            D’altra parte, nello studio integrato di tali dinamiche si riscontrano ancora numerose problematiche che si
            auspica possano essere superate attraverso l’acquisizione di nuovi dati e ulteriori indagini sul territorio.

        <Abstract>The site of Caričin Grad in south-eastern Serbia – currently listed on UNESCO’s tentative list – has
            been the subject of archaeological investigations for more than 100 years. For the last decades it has been
            the focus of a joint project of the Archaeological Institute in Belgrade and the École Française de Rome. A
            reconstruction of the economic, environmental and social history of the city is the main objective of a
            cooperative project started in 2014 with the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz. The remains of the
            early Byzantine complex of Caričin Grad show the features of a city built in the classical,
            Hellenistic-Roman tradition, combined with ecclesiastical Christian architecture. Based on the comparison of
            Byzantine text sources with the settlement’s topography and its architecture, Caričin Grad is supposed to be
            identical to Iustiniana Prima, a city newly founded by the Emperor Justinian as the region’s episcopal and
            administrative centre. With the period of occupation covering a mere 90 years, from circa AD 530 to circa AD
            615, the site allows a rare archaeological “snapshot” of a short period of very intensive use, which
            furthermore remained undisturbed from later encroachments. Due to these circumstances, Caričin Grad offers
            the unique opportunity to analyse a city at the turn of the Late Antique era to the Early Medieval epoch and
            the complex issues associated with periods of cultural transition. Based on the perspective of human ecology
            and social sciences, the project will establish new approaches and investigate the concept of “city” during
            periods of cultural transition by using methods of archaeozoology, archaeobotany, geoarchaeology, soil
            science and GIS. The main topic addressed within this context, “Households, consumption and everyday life”
            will deal with single domestic units concerning methods of production, consumption and activity zones
            regarding comestible goods. This perspective on the town and its consumption will be complemented by a
            viewpoint on the surrounding landscape focussing on its resources and agrarian production.

        <Abstract>This paper presents the methodological framework and the first results of a project launched in 2014
            entitled Recapturing the Dynamics of the Early Byzantine Settlements in Crete: Old problems | New
            Interpretations through an Interdisciplinary Approach. Through an interdisciplinary approach, combining a
            careful reading of historical and archaeological evidence with the spatial analysis offered by the
            application of new technologies in archaeological research, the project highlights the developments of
            Cretan settlements from the fourth century to the early ninth century. In particular, we will examine the
            data categories and discuss how they are brought together for analysis in a Geographical Information System.

        <Abstract>The Contessa Entellina survey is an intensive and systematic archaeological survey carried out in
            western Sicily, on an area extending over 136.4 km2, out of which more than 114 km2 were physically covered.
            The observation of settlement trends from the fourth to seventh centuries shows, on first glance, a
            noticeable drop in the number of sites from the third to fourth centuries, a new rise in the fifth century
            and a dramatic fall around the end of the century, followed by a period of stability or slow decrease
            throughout the sixth and seventh centuries. A more detailed analysis reveals, on the other hand, a much
            higher density of fifth century diagnostic artefacts (per site and per settled hectare), when compared with
            the previous and the two following centuries. The fifth century is therefore much more “visible” on the
            ground, and this may have contributed to the higher identification of fifth century sites. The massive
            presence of fifth century artefacts may not be exclusively due to a population increase: economic and
            socio-cultural factors most likely also came into play, distorting the resulting settlement picture. More
            precisely, a possible higher tendency towards a grain monoculture may have caused a massive import of
            African foodstuffs (attested by amphorae) between the late fourth and the middle fifth century, and peculiar
            dietary customs could explain the all-pervading diffusion of African Red Slip Ware cups belonging to the
            form Hayes 80-81. Similarly, if we take into consideration also less diagnostic artefacts such as roof
            tiles, we find that the fall in the number of sites between the end of the fifth and the sixth-seventh
            centuries may have been less drastic than it appears, and that it was followed by attempts to work out new
            settlement strategies, showing a fairly good resilience.

        <Abstract>Sulphur was important in several fields: military, tanning, wool’s disinfection and many other
            activities. Nevertheless, the largest quantity of sulphur was used in agriculture, particularly in
            viticulture as it was used to combat fungal diseases especially in wine production areas. Sicily, and in
            particular the area surrounding Agrigento, was the main site of sulphur extraction. This built strong
            relationships with Rome and other agricultural centres in the Mediterranean Sea. Very important among the
            historical sources and the archaeological evidence are the so called Tabulae sulphuris, concerning the
            sulphur exploitation at the Agrigento’s area. Recent finds and studies gave a new chronology dating to a few
            of the tegulae sulphuris and the related sulphur exploitation between the end of the fourth and the sixth
            centuries. It is now possible to attribute to Sicily (in particular, the “area solfifera”) the trade
            relationships which arose in Classical times. We must connect these commercial and cultural ties to the
            export of wheat and other commodities. The main goal of this paper is to show new data on the exploitation
            structures and the transformation of the mining landscape between Late Antiquity and the Byzantine Age.
            During this time, Agrigentum lost its function as fiscal centre, maybe because other centres were acquiring
            this role.

        <Abstract>In the period between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, the territory of L’Aquila underwent a
            number of transformations that also occurred elsewhere. The cities (Amiternum, Civita di Bagno, Peltuinum,
            Aufinum) suffered a heavy setback in their urban and economic development because of the general crisis of
            the Empire, the devastating effects of earthquakes in the second half of the fourth century, the
            Greek-Gothic war, the barbarian migrations and last, but not least, the changes in society and the
            ideological-cultural transformation induced by Christianisation. The relationship between town and country /
            city and territory undergoes fundamental changes, with different connotations in terms of landscape and
            settlements. The archaeological research and excavation of the surface, which we have carried out in the
            territory of L’Aquila for over a decade, is beginning to provide evidence of the results of the urban and
            rural landscape transformations: the Christianisation of space and functional transformation of major public
            and private facilities are confirmed by the discovery of churches replacing temples, as in Centurelli and in
            Piana San Marco and so on. Other evidence is provided by citadels obtained through the restoration of
            theatres and amphitheatres or city gates, as in the restorations and transformations of Peltuinum and
            Amiternum. We can also mention functional transformations such as private domus, sometimes with a long
            occupation of public spaces, such as in Amiternum and Peltuinum, or the defunctionalisation of
            infrastructures such as thermal complexes, roads, aqueducts and sewers. Homes or wooden cabins occupy the
            scene in the Amiternum theatre; churches like Santa Maria of Ansedonia abut the city walls. The rural
            landscape is changing for many reasons: the spread of Christian places of worship, the collapsing of public
            infrastructures such as roads or waterways, the advancement of wetlands and uncultivated areas and grazing
            activities to the detriment of agricultural areas. By the seventh century there is a further change in urban
            and agro-pastoral planning, which will be illustrated with concrete examples provided by the archaeological
            research we are carrying out.

        <Abstract>This paper draws its origin from a series of archaeological interventions led by the Soprintendenza
            per i Beni Archeologici della provincia Autonoma di Trento under the supervision of Cristina Bassi in the
            area called “piana Benacense”, a fertile plain near Riva del Garda, in the northern part of Lake Garda. The
            results of the excavation that took place in San Cassiano (2005-2006) are debated along with related
            anthropological studies. The site, placed beside the current Via Marone, follows the layout of an ancient
            Roman street characterised by the presence of burial areas. The area, about 6000 m2, presented the existence
            of a road that divided a Roman villa from two separated burial areas (dated respectively to the third and
            fourth centuries AD). The Roman villa, with structures that are dated from the first to the fourth centuries
            AD, included a large productive area better identified after the anthropological analysis of the individuals
            buried in the southern necropolis. In this area there were both incinerations and inhumations graves, all
            characterised by the same markers of osteological stress compatible to wool manufacturing. The smaller
            northern burial area was built for wealthier people, sometimes showing the traces of similar work
            activities. In the fifth-sixth centuries the landscape totally changed and a church was built, hosting a few
            high-status graves. The analysis of human remains revealed that all the individuals were males and showed
            the so-called “horseman syndrome” with some trauma fractures. We suppose that this leading group
            commissioned the church. After the fifth century, data agree upon a generalised implosion of economic
            structures, as confirmed by the markers of occupational stress on bones. Therefore the crossing of
            archeological and anthropological results trace the landscape history of the Benacense plain, from the
            well-organised and productive Roman period to a period lacking organisation and economic structures. This is
            the reason San Cassiano could be considered a significant component for the historical reconstruction of the
            Garda area in “the time of change”.

        <Abstract>In the early Christian period the birth and development of relics’ cult led to the transformation of
            urban, suburban and rural Italian landscape. Indeed, the deposition of venerated bodies in extra-muros
            cemeteries led to the gradual Christianisation of the whole peninsula. The link between territories and
            martyrs’ cults is shown by Christian Calendars, which reported just the dies natalis and the place of
            depositio. The saints were so territorially well established that their burials were simply considered as
            loca by ancient Christians. The gradual monumentalisation of martyrs’ tombs led to the birth of huge
            sanctuaries. They were composed of funerary and religious buildings but also service facilities,
            accommodations for pilgrims and monasteries. The most important sanctuaries were those of Saints Peter in
            the Vatican, Erasmus in Formia, Alexander in Nomentum, Felix in Cimitile, Januarius in Naples, Felix in
            Venosa, Marcianus in Syracuse and the Apostles in Concordia. They became so popular that Jerome said:
            ‘movetur urbs sedibus suis’. It seems that sometimes there was a coincidence between sanctuaries and
            episcopal palaces, such as in Sardinia, in some part of Latium and probably at Cimitile, Venosa and
            Concordia Sagittaria. In the fifth and sixth centuries some sanctuaries spread also in rural areas, usually
            along important routes. Suburban and rural sanctuaries led to the development of new settlements, as shown
            by the birth of new villages. The current word “Cimitile”, for example, derives from “Cimiterium” and even
            Paulinus of Nola wrote about a vicus nearby the sanctuary. At Saint Peter’s tomb, a Civitas was born in the
            Early Middle Ages. At the end of the Early Christian era, the traslationes broke the tie between relics and
            their locus depositionis, causing new urban sanctuaries to form.

        <Abstract>This research focuses on the process of late transformation and final abandonment of Roman towns, on
            the Christianisation phenomenon and on the late antique evolution of settlement patterns in central
            Lusitania. The traditional explanations of sudden abandonments of Roman centres, due to “external” events,
            were swept away by a more scientific approach to archaeological evidence. The article presents data on the
            Late Antiquity phases of Ammaia and Ebora Iulia (today Évora). The results of a long period of
            archaeo-topographical research on the deserted Roman town of Ammaia (Marvão, Portugal), supported by
            international scientific collaborations, disclose new scenarios. On the basis of the survey data, integrated
            with the results of the recent ground-truthing excavations, it is possible to state that, from the beginning
            of the fourth century AD, the town seemed to be interested in a process of transformation and not of
            degradation. Évora was a bigger town and it was, from the fourth century AD, the seat of the diocese. In
            fact, it was one of the first towns of Lusitania and its bishop was present at the Council of Elvira
            (306/314 AD). Évora, unlike Ammaia, had continuity of occupation and therefore archaeological research has
            to deal with the problems usually connected with urban archaeology. The intention is to draw a short summary
            about the transformations that characterise the two towns in this period and, finally, identify common
            elements and differences.

        <Abstract>Archaeomorphology, the study of human-made landscape forms such as roads, field systems, terraces,
            water channels, etc. is an important part of landscape studies. The archaeological features studied through
            archaeomorphological approaches display a long-term chronology and play an important role in the
            configuration of human habitat, movement and sustenance. In many cases, this role can still be appreciated
            in today’s cultural landscapes. However, during the last decades the archaeomorphological study of
            centuriations and other field systems has been considered a marginal and unscientific discipline. This is
            largely due to the multiplication of unreliable archaeomorphological studies on centuriations developed from
            the 70s to the 90s, some of which have been proved wrong by large-scale archaeological excavations.
            Nonetheless, the last decade has seen a revival of centuriation and other archaeomorphology-based studies.
            Events such as the 2009 international conference The application of centurial systems and methods of
            agrarian organisation from the Roman period to the early Middle Ages or the publication of Agri Centuriati,
            an International Journal of Landscape Archaeology beginning in 2004 have helped to put this discipline “back
            on the map”.

        <Abstract>In this work we intend to illustrate methods and tools used for evaluating and defining some of the
            post-depositional processes of the archaeological record in the Eastern Beneventan landscapes. Our research
            aims especially to recognise the traces of the “longue durée” phenomena, highlighting what may be considered
            a result of the past still observable in the present. Which are the tools that allow us to identify
            landscapes marks, anthropogenic and environmental processes responsible of the survival or, conversely, of
            the obliteration of the ancient forms? A first approach attempts to create a dialogic relationship with the
            historical cartographic documents (such as ancient cadastres, notarial instruments, boundary disputes) and
            sheds light on the dynamics of the perceptible transformations of landscapes, bringing back an overall view
            of their contextual distinctive traits. This ensures the identification of “ecofacts” and “artefacts” that
            contributes to the structuration of the landscapes that have occurred over time as stratified units. A
            second procedure involves the reading of the historical information combined with the environmental one,
            through an archaeomorphological approach. The study has provided an overlap among the ancient and modern
            rural fabrics (for example roads, canals, talwegs, agrarian boundaries) and the geomorphological dynamics,
            with the aim of discerning the forms of degradation and to define, when possible, a relative chronology.
            Such an approach evaluates the distribution of surface artefacts and their spatial and temporal
            characteristics, enabling recording of the higher or lower level of degradation in the archaeological
            record, emphasising those landscapes units considered of high information potential.

        <Abstract>In this paper we analyse the contribution that archaeomorfological analysis of road networks can bring
            to the study of landscape dynamics, focusing on the study case of the low Venetian plain between Padua and
            Rovigo. Methodologically, we found our work on a study published by Eric Vion in 1989 where, for the first
            time, the Swiss scholar defended the importance of the morphological study of communication routes to
            understand the historical evolution of a territory. By applying the basic principles of this method, we have
            analysed the territory in order to highlight its main evolutionary stages.So we could establish that, after
            a series of interventions dating back to Protohistoric times, the first real large-scale landscape
            structuration was carried out by the Romans, initially (second century BC) by drafting a series of extra
            regional routes designed to connect the northernmost colony of Aquileia with the southern strongholds of
            Ariminum, Mutina, and Bononia and, later (first century BC-first century AD), by implementing the road
            network through the realization of new routes and at least three different centuriated field systems in the
            territories controlled by Patavium, Ateste and Atria.With the fall of the Roman Empire during Late
            Antiquity, all these infrastructures had to be partly abandoned and partly re-functionalized by seconding
            the changed needs of the rural population. Around the 10th century, it seems possible to date the first
            setting of a series of so-called radial systems that deeply modify the previous centurial infrastructures,
            while between 11th and 13th centuries, a series of interventions on the road network were promoted by the
            city of Padua. Finally, from fifteenth to eighteenth century, new interventions (construction of new roads
            and channels and reclamation works) were carried out, especially in the lagoon area, by the government of

        <Abstract>The historic territory of Valencia is being analysed in the frame of a new research project, Valentia
            Landscape Project, aiming to characterise the dynamics of the Valencian Cultural Landscape from the Iron Age
            (seventh - sixth century BC) to the Modern period. An important part of the project is focused on Antiquity
            and one of its major goals is reviewing through a new archaeomorphological analysis, the ancient road
            network, in order to study historical field systems and to analyse the centuriation hypothesis proposed up
            to now. The archaeomorphological analysis has allowed us to propose new hypothesis about the origin and
            dynamics of the Valencian Cultural Landscape. In this sense, the study has attested the presence, in the
            present landscape, of many axes whose origin is related to the Roman centuriated road system.
            Multidisciplinarity and a long-term approach have brought a high level of precision to this work’s results.

        <Abstract>This paper explores the advantages of using satellite remote sensing and GIS to identify ancient land
            divisions in the eastern Mediterranean by studying the organisation of modern agrarian landscapes. Since
            current land divisions sometimes retain the arrangement of an older system, either wholly or partially,
            remote sensing methodologies have been successful in distinguishing ancient demarcations, especially Roman
            centuriation. This study places emphasis on techniques to recover past landscapes around settlements where
            the correlation between modern agrarian divisions and a potential ancient system is not clear from visual
            interpretation. Within GIS the dominant orientations of modern agrarian fields are analysed and presented as
            histograms which show general trends in the organisation of land. These methodologies are applied in two
            case-studies where the evidence for an ancient urban or rural land division is not well-defined: Mantinea, a
            classical Greek city in the Peloponnese, and Aphrodisias, a Late Hellenistic foundation in western Anatolia.
            The histograms identify trends in the organisation of modern fields that might mark the presence of an
            ancient system of land demarcation. The data from Mantinea show that the majority of modern agricultural
            fields inside the fortification walls have dominant orientations identical to the alignments of excavated
            buildings and a series of streets revealed through geophysical survey. Likewise, there is evidence at
            Aphrodisias that rural land outside the fortification walls share orientations with urban features inside
            the city. Both examples show that an analysis of the dominant angle frequency of modern land divisions is
            useful for reconstructing the archaeomorphology of ancient landscapes in the eastern Mediterranean.

        <Abstract>The French Rhône valley has traces of ancient roman parcels, testified by antique land registers
            called “Orange cadastre”. This organisation was highlighted on the left bank of the river and it seems to
            extend to the other side, in the Tave and Cèze valleys. All this research was conducted in the 80s from the
            French National Institute of Cartography (IGN) aerial missions using the method of optical filtering. In
            this study, we intend to use a GIS and the cadastral map in vector format (BDParcellaire® product from IGN).
            Indeed, the cadastre enables the study of boundaries that have no materialisation in the current landscape.
            The aerial photographs or topographical maps only give incomplete information, i.e. the perennial human
            forms or roads, paths, fences, channels, ditches. These documents are selective. The tool used in this study
            is the histogram of directions. It consists in calculating the azimuth of each parcel boundary and drawing a
            histogram. The number of boundaries or their total length is shown as a function of the azimuth. The
            interests of working with the cadastre are that all information are contained in these documents, their
            precision allows a detailed study of cadastral frames. This method was first validated on previously studied
            areas and then extended to the Cèze and Tave lower valleys. This helped to detect the presence of “Orange
            cadastre” in these two valleys, where the method by optical filtering had not delivered convincing results.
            The use of these vector data for the detection of ancient cadastral frames permits a detailed study of the
            boundaries structure. The results are encouraging and allow the consideration of new approaches. It would be
            interesting to combine elevation and topographic data as well as ancient “Napoleonic cadastre” with the aim
            to eliminate nineteenth and twentieth century boundaries.

        <Abstract>The territorial organisation of rural areas in the context of the Roman Empire is a widely discussed
            issue in archaeomorphological research but it is also a topic of great interest for the study of long-term
            landscapes dynamics. Most of these studies deal with large territorial management works related to known
            ancient cities. In this paper we propose a discussion about a study case carried out on a much more reduced
            scale, focused in a small river valley, placed in an inland area near Barcelona in the North-Eastern sector
            of the Iberian Peninsula. In this research both the analysis of road network from aerial photographs and the
            study of settlement patterns from the Archaeological Heritage database are complemented by fieldwork, survey
            and the regressive analysis of historical maps. A geomorphological study of the area is actually in
            progress. A significant relationship has been highlighted between an ancient Roman road and an intensive
            settlement network along this historical road axis. Settlement distribution along the studied stretch seems
            to show a pattern related to well-known measures used in Roman land-surveys. According to the chronology of
            these sites, this spatial organisation may coincide with the consolidation processes of a Roman urban
            network at the Tarraconensis province. This process took place during the first century BC, especially from
            the second half of that century. In this paper, the results will be discussed and analysed in order to
            understand how far the data available allow us to interpret landscape organisation in relation to
            geomorphological and environmental dynamics.

        <Abstract>This paper argues that the works of the Agrimensores are of value in studying the practicalities of
            land measurement in the Roman world. It discusses ways in which the Agrimensores might be used, not only
            based on a strict literal reading of the texts, but on the practical circumstances in which these works
            could be used. The paper combines the statements of the Agrimensores with evidence from Roman literary and
            legal sources and from archaeology. It uses the colony Arausio, modern Orange in southern France, as a case
            study. The paper concludes that the works of the Agrimensores was based on real situations, examples of
            which can be found in the map of Arausio. The Agrimensores therefore attempted to give general instructions
            based on situations they had encountered in the field. Sometimes these seem overly schematic or abstract,
            but this matches the style of Roman legal writing. It is true that the works of the Agrimensores have often
            been misused in scholarly research, but the paper argues that these texts can be of great value when used in
            combination with archaeological evidence and other legal and technical texts. Thus, these works can be used
            to gain a better understanding of the practicalities of Roman land measurement.

        <Abstract>The paper presents a multidisciplinary research project (“Archaeology of Commons: cultural Heritage
            and Material Evidence of a Disappearing Europe”) on the archaeology of common-lands. The main goal of the
            project is to investigate, by means of historical and archaeological analysis, the intimate social dimension
            at the base of the common lands management in the context of southern European mountainous regions. Research
            investigates the dynamic nature of commons starting from the reconstruction of the present organisation of
            common lands, going back to the complex transformations of common properties in the nineteenth century and
            analysing the problem of the archaeological visibility of conflicts since the ancien régime. The project
            will examine how archaeological methods could clarify different aspects of the history of the collective
            access rights to land, by applying in selected mountain areas methodological approaches based on historical
            ecology, rural and agrarian archaeology.

        <Abstract>An exploitation system of rock quarries was investigated along a tract of the ancient Appian Way
            extending between the modern villages of Itri and Fondi (central Italy). Three new quarries carved into
            carbonatic slopes were discovered through interpretation of aerial photography and photogrammetric
            restitution (this last still in progress) nearby a few extraction areas already acknowledged in previous
            works. Later, field surveys confirmed the anthropogenic nature of slope cuts as inferred from squared or
            rectangular morphological edges and evidence of regular tool-marks. Quarries location and exploitation
            techniques were analysed in relation to the archaeological requirements for the road construction and
            maintenance and also considering the geological setting of the area. In particular, it was demonstrated how
            geometric characteristics of rock masses – such as bedding and joint system spacing or intensity of brittle
            deformation – played a fundamental role in determining the kind of extracted material and use of different
            exploitation techniques. Indeed, cubic and pseudo-cubic rock blocks were extracted from quarries A and B
            during the Roman Age, as evidenced by peculiar tool-marks observed on the rock slope edges and tracing
            intersecting joint system. Quarry C was instead an open-pit derived from a cataclastic rock volume in the
            hanging-wall of a main normal fault and from which centimetres-sized debris were derived. The present study
            set the basis for a further analysis of the local exploitation system which may include other minor quarries
            used for road maintenance works and construction of other buildings.

        <Abstract>The project presented in this paper is concerned with the funeral rite of the Tumulus cultural
            community located on the border of Silesia and Greater Poland. Detailed multi-disciplinary analyses have
            been applied to a unique slice of the Bronze Age cultural landscape preserved within the cover of a 100-year
            old oak forest known as the Krotoszyn Forest. Preliminary research carried out by the author (rescue
            excavations, non-invasive prospection and airborne laser scanning) revealed the existence of 120 barrows,
            which are likely to be associated with the dominance of the Tumulus Culture in areas of south-west Poland.
            The information obtained by previous studies was included in the spatial database available to the author.
            It provides basic information on the location, state of preservation and the amount of burial mounds in the
            area of the Krotoszyn Forest. The main aim of the project is to carry out multi-dimensional spatial analysis
            in order to capture the relationship between the variables governing the environment and Tumulus Culture
            burials. The methodological approach adopted by the project consists of the GIS analysis of data obtained
            from the airborne laser scanning, palaeoenvironmental studies and the application of geophysical
            prospection. The project’s targets include the development of an interpretative model able to explain the
            rules of location and strategies of construction of the funeral space of the Tumulus Culture community. The
            proposed models will be drawn upon theoretical reflections related to the concept of landscape archaeology.

        <Abstract>La valle della Caffarella ricade all’interno del Parco Regionale dell’Appia Antica e si trova al di
            fuori delle Mura Aureliane, tra la via Latina e via dell’Appia Antica, tagliata verso sud da via
            dell’Almone. La valle di origine alluvionale è costituita da pianori sommitali tufacei, versanti leggermente
            scoscesi ed un fondovalle ricco di falde acquifere e di numerose sorgenti di acque minerali. Particolarmente
            rilevante è la presenza del fiume Almone sacro ai Romani, ancora oggi terzo fiume di Roma per portata, e dei
            fossi alimentati dalle numerose sorgenti locali, note già in epoca romana. Anticamente nella valle della
            Caffarella si sviluppava un reticolo idrografico molto più complesso di quello attuale. Le originarie aree
            paludose connaturate alla geomorfologia della valle, sono state bonificate nel corso dei secoli tramite una
            serie di opere idrauliche, come canali di convogliamento e drenaggio di varie epoche o la creazione in età
            moderna di fossi scaricatori regolati da chiuse detti anche “marrane” o “incastri”. Molti di questi
            manufatti sono visibili o rintracciabili ancora oggi nella valle e testimoniano le numerose attività
            antropiche realizzate per il controllo delle acque in superficie. Mettendo insieme le informazioni ottenute
            da cartografia storica, foto aeree, sopralluoghi e documentazione degli scavi archeologici recenti, si può
            offrire un contributo alla ricostruzione della idrografia storica di questo lembo di campagna romana di
            grande interesse ambientale e storico archeologico (fig. 1).

        <Abstract>In this paper,we discuss the results of an artefact survey and a sampling collection in the indigenous
            settlement of Terravecchia di Cuti, in the chora of the Greek colony of Himera (Sicily). The whole area of
            the town was gridded with squares of 10x10 m to isolate functional areas and identify the most interesting
            zones for new archaeological samples. The survey was carried out in two fields (9400 m2), counting and
            recording all findings. Only diagnostic pottery and figured pottery, antefixes, loom weights, millstones and
            so on were collected. We can observe, analysing in detail our results for both fields, that functional areas
            could not be isolated, perhaps because the urban and social organisation of the settlement did not provide
            for clear distinctions. The multi-functionality of everyday objects, also, does not allow us to recognise
            these areas. Finally, we must consider the effect of decades of ploughing carried out on the site.

        <Abstract>Mountains and high ground are often venerated as special places. It is their enigmatic quality as
            elevated ground, their prominence and permanence in both the mental and physical landscapes that draws us to
            them. In this paper the role of mountains in current landscape archaeology is discussed based on their role
            as places of significance in both “visible” and “invisible” landscapes. The conspicuous mountain of Turlough
            Hill, in the Burren, Co. Clare has on its summit a unique group of prehistoric remains consisting of some
            140 circular houses, a large burial cairn, a multi-vallate enclosure as well as an extraordinary hexagonal
            stone enclosure. Why did people choose this particular mountaintop as the focus for this extraordinary
            activity in prehistory? To answer this question, and to elucidate the wider question of the significance of
            high ground, as well as aspects of place-making, the role of Turlough Hill in prehistory is discussed based
            on the character of the archaeological remains, but also on the character of the mountain itself and its
            location in the wider landscape.

        <Abstract>Ruvo di Puglia is located in the continuity of life in central Puglia. It stands on a hill located
            between the area Murgia and the Adriatic coast. The first traces of the area date back to the Middle and
            Upper Paleolithic and the phase is documented peuceta with numerous monumental tombs with rich graves. At
            the beginning of the third century BC, Ruvo becomes a member before becoming municipium after the social
            war. The survival of the city was guaranteed by the Via Minucia which connected Benevento to Brindisi
            through Puglia. This road will become the Traiana in Imperial times, ensuring continuity of life in the
            city. Nevertheless, the town lost its hegemony and was greatly reduced. One of the few pieces of epigraphic
            evidence of Roman attests to the presence of a surrounding wall of which no trace remains: what is preserved
            material dates from the Aragonese domination. The attention is focused on the origins of Ruvo in the early
            nineteenth century, following the random discoveries of rich grave peuceta. This phenomenon contributes to
            wage a “excavations fever” and plundering of a necropolis with consequent destruction of the ancient urban
            fabric. Encouraged by Borbonic Government, the results of these excavations went to increase the actual
            collection of the Museum Borbonico of Naples and private collections around the world.

            ancient urban planning and its development during the Greek, Roman and Medieval ages, and for the management
            and preservation of the archaeological heritage of Taormina; in fact, the new archaeological map could be
            included in policies aimed at an urban development that respects the existing ancient remains and promotes
            their enhancement of value. The paper concerns the research project started in 2009 and aimed at the
            production of the archaeological map of Tauromenion/Tauromenium, on which the modern Taormina lies. The
            project is carried out by the Department of Ancient and Modern Cultures of the University of Messina and the
            Institute for Archaeological and Monumental Heritage of the Italian National Research Council, with the
            cooperation of the Archaeological Superintendence of the Province of Messina and the Archaeological Park of
            Giardini Naxos. The research project involves a context characterised by a long continuity of life during
            centuries and it is based on:1) archaeological and topographical surveys using a differential GPS system and
            a total station;2) systematic study and analysis of archival documentation, previous bibliographies and
            historical cartographies;3) interpretation of aerial photos, in particular those taken between the years
            1920s and 1940s, when some sectors of the ancient city and necropolises were not still covered by the
            extension of the modern town. All the collected data were georeferenced in a digital archaeological map,
            where all the ancient monuments and structures, both still visible and those re-buried after small-scale
            excavations, are integrated on a up-to-date large-scale vector cartography. The map is integrated in a
            web-oriented GIS platform developed using open source software and cloud computing solutions; it is aimed at
            the data management and sharing between the different institutions involved in the project. Therefore, the
            research is aimed at the production of a tool that could be useful both for the reconstruction of the
            ancient urban planning and its development during the Greek, Roman and Medieval ages, and for the management
            and preservation of the archaeological heritage of Taormina; in fact, the new archaeological map could be
            included in policies aimed at an urban development that respects the existing ancient remains and promotes
            their enhancement of value.

        <Abstract>The text synthesizes an analysis of the meaning and function of city walls through a series of
            examples of urban settlements founded, or renewed, in cental-northern Italy, between the end of the Republic
            and the First Imperial Age. A period in which, in different geographical areas, different monumental results
            were produced. In some cases the need for defense is still relevant and the structure of city walls, gates
            and towers, reveal this need. Despite the Pax Augusta, the phenomenon of brigandage, in primis, imposes in
            some areas a certain attention to their defensive function. In other cases, the city walls may have existed
            to perform functions different than that of defensive; functions that are not limited only to a symbolic
            ritual matrix. In this process, even the city gates are transformed, entering in symbiosis with the
            monumental typology of the honorary arch and becoming, sometimes, a real commemorative monument of
            particular events. The prestige of the location of this monumental typology in the city wall is completely
            independent from the validity of the defensive walls. The city walls interact with the doors and with the
            towers both functionally and formally. Now, their task is not to close the village in a rigid
            internal/external alternative but rather to create a dialogue between the reality of the settlement and what
            surrounds it. This dialogue takes place, thanks to the doors and to other structures, both man-made, such as
            bridges, or natural, such as courses of water, paying attention to the element of the spatial perspective,
            that emerges, now, in many cases of urban renewal and thanks to which is created an interaction between the
            city and the outside world.

        <Abstract>The results of the surveys made in the Brindisi area, territory of Mesagne, have produced new data
            demonstrating in the importance of systematic explorations to increase the knowledge of the forms of
            territorial organisation. Between the main historical phases that have characterised this area, we intend to
            present the one between the Roman Age and the Late Antiquity. A period that, unlike other districts (even
            neighbouring), reveals for the Brindisi area a clear increase of the rural population and deep changes in
            forms of land use.

        <Abstract>The urban area of Aquinum, a Roman city situated along via Latina between Frosinone (Frusino) and
            Cassino (Casinum), was investigated by aero-topographical studies, geophysical prospecting and
            archaeological field survey. All research activity was done by the Laboratory of Ancient Topography and
            Photogrammentry of the University of Salento. The executed explorative interventions have considered the
            results of the data processed as well as all documents related to the systematic surveys realised in the
            framework of the Ager Aquinas project. The substance of the archaeological deposits, the wealth of ancient
            materials and the remains highlighted constitute indicators of positive conditions for the planning of
            archaeological research oriented to confirming all that was individuated by the field surveys, aerial
            photographs and geophysical prospecting. These studies have allowed the reconstruction of the urban layout
            of Aquinum. Planning for the archaeological interventions was based not only on the results but also on the
            processing of data regarding field survey and on the compelling need for the preservation of the
            area.Starting with the collected data, six archaeological excavation campaigns have been carried out between
            2009 and 2014 in Aquinum. The research, after confirming the aerotopographical and geophysical results,
            focused on an area of the town that, until that time, had provided nothing useful for the recognition of
            monuments and urban spaces. Great results have been obtained thanks to the archaeological excavation
            campaigns led at the heart of the ancient Roman town. Knowledge of a central part of the built-up area has
            improved including where there are public buildings already known (theatre, an apsis-building) and unknown
            (public thermal baths). This is the keystone for better protection of the archaeological site and to future
            preservation for the area.

        <Abstract>Research on the prehistoric and proto-historic landscape in Sardinia (Italy) allows knowledge and
            analysis of the island’s archaeological heritage. Besides, recent studies have aimed to delineate the type
            of relationship that the prehistoric and proto-historic societies established with the variegated Sardinian
            landscape in connection with the ways of articulation and territorial appropriation, without neglecting the
            important and fundamental aspect of economic organisation of the territory. From this point of view, we want
            to analyse, as a sample-area, the region that includes the communal territory of Mogoro, in central-western
            Sardinia. Particularly we studied the ways of anthropisation and fruition of the landscape in proto-historic
            age, with the objective to reconstruct, through the study of the settlements and the relationships among
            them, some of the economic and social aspects of those groups of nuragic culture that enjoyed this area from
            the Middle Bronze Age to the Iron Age. The area of Mogoro has been intensively investigated from the half of
            the past century; the investigations then culminated with the stratigraphical investigation carried out
            beginning in 1994 near the site of Cuccurada, the main centre of an articulated territorial system including
            a rich network of monuments related to the nuragic civilisation, such as nuraghi, giants’ tombs and
            villages. In this work we present the results obtained through various research methods: geomorphological
            analysis, spatial analyst GIS tools (Viewshed, Cost Surface and Least-cost path analyses) and multivariate
            analysis (cluster and principal components analysis) that allow us to set a new hypothesis on population
            dynamics in this area and to individuate, among proto-historical monuments, one or more homogeneous and
            distinguished groups, starting from a database that results from indexing geomorphological characteristics.

            South Italy) through the analysis of archaeological traces in historical and recent aerial photographs, both
            vertical (IGM images taken in 1954 and in 1955, IRTA, AM and RAF photographs, colour orthophotos) and
            oblique. As is well known, the plain of the Tavoliere was densely inhabited during the Neolithic Age and
            analysis of aerial photographs showed noteworthy examples of archaeological evidence related to
            topographical organisation of villages, delimited by one or more ditches containing more or less dense
            series of compounds. Such complexes are located, in most cases, near waterways that have sometimes dried up,
            in the areas interfluvial or on plateaus and shallow edge of scarp; in the western sector of the territory
            not many prehistoric settlements appear in aerial photographs and they are mainly located at slight
            elevations, neighbouring modern farms. The georeferencing and graphic rendering of archaeological traces of
            the Neolithic settlement allowed the measurement of their extension. In some cases the analysis of
            archeological traces in aerial photographs have found a topographic continuity between Neolithic settlements
            and Medieval fortifications, in areas characterised by the presence of slight hills featuring geological
            outcrop (locally known as “crusta”); this data has been confirmed by field survey. The interpretation of the
            many visible traces, their geo-referencing and graphic rendering, combined with topographical survey make an
            important contribution to the reconstruction of settlement dynamics of the prehistoric period. The
            integrated study of the historical and recent aerial photos was particularly functional when used to analyse
            archaeological contexts, no longer visible in recent aerial photos, and has facilitated a detailed analysis
            of the archaeological traces. The georeferenced data were, in part, controlled with field survey that has
            better defined the chronology of the archeological traces.

        <Abstract>Historic landscape and cultural heritage are often integrated into a system of protection and
            valorisation through the global approach of archaeology and landscape archaeology. This system is conceived
            as a territorial study collecting all the evidence of human presence and its history, allowing the
            assessment of the historical and archaeological component through evolutionary dynamics. Therefore the study
            of landscape archaeology is central to the design and programming of territorial works. The “landscape
            system”, the result of the coexistence of environmental and human dynamics, has meant that territorial
            transformation processes have become the object of scientific interest assuming considerable political
            importance. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a geophysical prospections for a map of the
            archaeological potential of the territory of Flumeri in Avellino, Italy. This diagnostic contribution was
            designed to give a distinctive and better representation of the territory. The scientific approach chosen
            for this project is the result of a multidisciplinary convergence: bibliographical and archival research,
            analysis of topographic and photogrammetric surveys, systematic investigations of the territory and
            geophysical survey. These diverse non-invasive geophysical methods allowed us to define and detail the
            archaeological potential of the studied area in a better way; by defining micro-areas of geophysical survey
            starting with defining macro-areas of high archaeological potential. This approach has a double value: the
            geophysical surveys serve as a support for the archaeological knowledge of the area and the archaeological
            knowledge helps towards the identification of areas for geophysical survey.

        <Abstract>The study area is located in the mid Calore valley, between the Calore and the Ufita Rivers. From
            prehistoric times, the territory has constituted an important crossroad among Campania, Apulia and Lucania,
            ensuring a connection between the Tyrrenian and Adriatic coast. The importance of the area grew with the
            construction of the via Appia, in the third century BC. Along its route, as documented by itinerary sources,
            in the early first century BC the municipium of Aeclanum (Passo di Mirabella – Mirabella Eclano, AV) was
            founded. A significant part of the research project regards this city: archaeological field surveys were
            carried out in the urban area and along the city walls, still partially preserved, with the aim to clarify
            its route. The new collected data were georeferenced in an aerophotogrammetric map, together with the data
            deriving from 1960s archaeological excavations and systematic study of archival documents of the
            Superintendence of Salerno, Avellino, Benevento and Caserta Province. The map was realised in the LabTAF of
            the University of Salento and constitutes the first large scale archaeological map of the ancient city.
            Systematic archaeological field walking was carried out on the territory corresponding partially to the ager
            Aeclanensis. It aimed at the reconstruction of the ancient topography of the territory surrounding the Roman
            site thanks to the large number of settlements documented. These settlements attest to the inhabitation of
            the area since the prehistoric and proto-historic times to the Medieval period. All collected data are
            georeferenced in the archaeological map that also allows diachronic analyses of the territory.

        <Abstract>Agricultural terraces have been a necessary element in the landscapes of Classical and Hellenistic
            periods in many areas of the Greek world. These terraces, formed by long terrace walls, shaped the slopes in
            the proximity of the farmhouses in order to facilitate exploitation of the land by the farmers, providing
            all the necessary conditions for efficient and effective cultivation of olive trees, grains, vines and
            almost any other crop. Various sites with agricultural terraces in the area of Attica, especially in the
            territory of the ancient deme of Atene (such as PH 2 in Aghia Photini and TH 18/42 in Thymari) as well as
            the Cycladic islands (Delos and Kea), dated to the Classical and Hellenistic period, are provided in this
            paper as some very characteristic examples of ancient terraced systems. Despite the thorough discussions
            about the dating of agricultural terraces in previous years, the issue of dating them back to ancient years
            remains an existent question for some scholars. Nevertheless, the sites mentioned here offer fairly good
            evidence for a dating in the fifth or fourth centuries BC. Furthermore, all these cases seem to share a
            common factor: their construction results from or is related to demographic criteria, such as the population
            growth of every area.

        <Abstract>A large number of lakes, lagoons, deltas, wetlands and flood plains converge in Andalusia. The
            analysis of lake and marsh areas during Roman times has been a historical subject insufficiently considered
            so far by Spanish historiographers. This research aims to undertake the study of those more significant
            cases of High Guadalquivir (Jaén), always within the Roman Baetica context. Focusing on the interaction
            among culture and environment, landscape ecology and socio-natural systems, the authors aim to comprehend
            the relation of rural settlements to these environments to study various methods of exploiting lagoon areas
            and to analyse lacustrine landscapes in the historical context of the Roman period.

        <Abstract>The paper concerns a research project carried out since 2011 by the Department of Sciences on the
            Antiquity of the University of Messina and the Institute for Archaeological and Monumental Heritage of the
            Italian National Research Council. The project is aimed at the reconstruction of the ancient topography of
            the territory of the modern village of Rodì-Milici, in the Province of Messina. The first campaign of
            systematic archaeological and topographical surveys, using a differential GPS system and a Laser Scanner,
            were performed in the hills to the west and south-west of the two villages, in particular on the large
            plateau between Monte Ciappa, to the north, and Pizzo Cocuzza, to the south. The investigated area was
            identified by L. Bernabò Brea, at the beginning of the 1950s, with the site of the ancient city of Longane.
            It had a strategic location for the control of the valleys of the Patrì and Mazzarrà rivers (respectively to
            the east and west of the investigated area) which constituted important routes of connection and traffic
            between the Tyrrhenian coast, the Monti Peloritani area and the Ionian coast of Sicily. The recent research,
            in integration with previous studies, acquired new data about the Archaic settlement that had an
            organisation strictly integrated to the topographical context and a structure different from traditional
            Greek colonies. The settlement on the plateau did not have a regular plan but seems organised into quite
            well distinguished inhabited, productive and sacred areas, while other areas are free of structures. It was
            protected by the two fortified hills (Monte Ciappa and Pizzo Cocuzza) which controlled the natural entrances
            to the plateau from north and south; the necropolises were located to the north-east and south of these
            hills, along the principal ways to arrive to the settlement.

        <Abstract>The contribution presents a summary of the methodology and preliminary results of the research project
            Finziade and Lower Valley of Southern Himera of the Department of Ancient and Modern Civilisations,
            University of Messina. The goal of this project was to reconstruct how the territory of Licata (AG) on the
            southern coast of Sicily was settled. The area is of significant importance in the process of colonisation
            of the island since it is at the mouth of the main river. Monte Sant’Angelo, where the Hellenistic city of
            Finziade was found, was the subject of systematic investigations and monographic studies by the University
            of Messina. A recent analysis (2010-2012) of the so-called “Mountain”, the range of hills around Finziade,
            was the subject of a doctoral project (in press) that presented a detailed representation of the area’s
            settlement dynamic from prehistory to Late Antiquity. In 2012, on the basis of the new research, it was
            decided to expand the framework of the investigation by analysing the vast plains and the hills surrounding
            the “Mountain”. This research allows us to make the first historic assessment and settlement models, both
            relating to the period before the foundation of Finziade (282 BC) and for the later periods. The greatest
            population density is recorded in the “Castellucciana Age”, in the first half of the second millennium BC
            and later, after the foundation of Agrigento, with numerous nuclei of a non-urban nature, and in the early
            Hellenistic period with numerous rural and military settlements, among which emerge the two fortified towns
            of Monte Sole and Poggio Marcato d’Agnone. Important is the finding of several new areas containing clay
            fragments of the Imperial Era and Late Antiquity, probably due to rural villages or production centres.
            These villages, probably following a long tradition, exploited the fertile soil and used the port at the
            mouth of the Himera River, as remembered in the land and sea routes from the Late Roman period.

        <Abstract>Rome’s contemporary city-structure in municipalities incorporated into the modern suburbs those
            boundary areas that in ancient times spread from the city walls (i.e. the urbanised city) towards the
            territory, forming a transit zone between city and country. The present paper intends to highlight the
            significance of these areas, main indicators not only from a historic-archaeological point of view, with
            respect to the knowledge of the ancient settlement’s distribution and evolution within the territory, but
            especially with regards to the modern landscape’s transformation, becoming pivotal areas that urbanists and
            town planners should take into consideration for conservation and usage. Our study analyses the territory of
            Rome’s Municipio XIII EST. This area shows a landscape that underwent a radical transformation throughout
            centuries, due to the changed requirements of the different social realities that followed each other from
            ancient Roman times until today. This casestudy shows clearly how the strong urbanistic expansion that
            started strongly in the 1960s extended like wild fire from the city centre towards the outside, becoming a
            rural landscape characterised by small properties and vast rural estates, on a surface with high housing
            industry. This caused the obliteration of the ancient landscape order, directly absorbed into the city and
            covered under many cement layers, without even verifying the historical value in previous forms of rural
            settlement. The widespread use of new technologies and territorial informative systems, like SITAR, Sistema
            Informativo Territoriale Archeologico di Roma of the Soprintendenza Speciale per il Colosseo, il Museo
            Nazionale Romano e l’Area Centrale di Roma, allows us to put together in a more rapid and complete way all
            the information from the various sources (historical cartographies, archives and bibliographic research,
            archaeological exploration of material data) and enables the knowledge and reconstruction of historical
            contexts.

        <Abstract>This paper presents the research method applied to the Archaeological Map of Italy – Forma Italiae
            project, comprising to date the Ager Venusinus project (completed) and the Ager Lucerinus project (ongoing).
            The methodology of the project is based on the extensive and systematic survey of the entire selected
            district. The countryside is systematically searched by groups of students and researchers in different
            seasons, time of the day, weather and visibility conditions, and status of cultivation of the ground. The
            GPS georeferenced data are integrated in a GIS specifically realised. The results of the research projects
            relating to the territory of the Luceria’s colony, in Apulia, starting from the area of the medieval site of
            Montecorvino, in the Daunian district is presented. So far the part of the vast territory of Lucera studied
            concerns the area North-East of the ancient Latin colony. Discussed here are studies conducted on the
            western area, towards the Daunian subappennine and in particular focused on the territory of the
            municipalities of Lucera, Pietramontecorvino, Motta Montecorvino, and Volturino. This area, in fact, is the
            object of research that includes the whole of the Fortore River valley. The data emerging from recent
            surveys show a large population over the time-span from prehistory to the High Middle Ages. The settlements
            of the Neolithic and Bronze ages, so far identified, are placed on vast plains; on the northern sector of
            the territory, it is possible to catch a glimpse of traces of a village characterised by the typical C
            shaped ditch, with huts located inside. A very interesting part of our project regards Dauni and Samnite
            settlements in the period preceding the arrival of the Romans and the Romanisation of the area. The most
            notable transformations in the ancient landscape were undoubtedly produced by the Roman intervention that
            gave birth to the new colony and the planning of the village centre, which consequently led to the
            reorganisation of a vast territory and the division of the rural area into a dense network of small
            properties assigned to the settlers.

        <Abstract>The data presented are the preliminary results of the interdisciplinary project FIRB named Landscape
            archaeology of the Adriatic “Puglia” in the Roman Age: innovative technologies for sustainable planning and
            knowledge of cultural identity, carried out since 2013 by the University of Molise (with a leading role),
            the University of Bari and the Politecnico of Bari. The project deals with the old landscape of Egnazia
            through a global approach, underlining the role of settlement dynamics, exploitation of natural resources,
            manufacturing activities and trading and cultural exchanges within the Mediterranean basin. For the first
            time this topographic research has allowed a systematic review of the territory through a complete survey of
            the surface, mostly unknown before. The results of the survey are connected with the information about the
            old town, largely explored thanks to the Project Egnazia: from Digging to Evaluation directed by Raffaella
            Cassano since 2001. The analysis of the data, referring both to the town and the territory, allows the
            identification of a strong settling structure, which is subjected to many transformations from the Bronze
            Age till Late Antiquity. Only a single feature is always visible during the whole ancient history of this
            place: the settlement was deeply affected by the viability and the distribution of the “lame” (landform
            smaller than a ravine), deep furrows in the natural stony bedrock used as water tanks and a link road
            between the hills and the Adriatic Sea.

        <Abstract>The present remarks derive from on-going topographic-archaeological projects focusing on North coastal
            Etruria and South Picenum. These studies apply a global archaeology approach that includes diachronic and
            interdisciplinary research. In our projects particular attention is being paid to palaeogeographic aspects.
            Processual methodology standards are applied to our research; nevertheless, geomorphologic, spatial and
            quantitative evidence is integrated with qualitative and symbolic data to reconstruct all the anthropic
            activities. Some remarks will be made about the informative potential of ploughsoil findings, landscape
            complexity, strategies in collecting and studying pottery and on the importance of considering the absence
            of particular categories of materials. Following this global approach and its consequential theoretical
            framework and rigorous methodology, archaeologists will be able to take up the interpretative challenge of
            defining landscapes in terms of their different components: sites, off-sites and their historical-functional
            classification. Obviously, the objective and subjective standards used for these classifications have to be
            explained clearly, so that the research results of a district can be used for comparisons and large-scale
            analyses.

        <Abstract>The Laboratory of Ancient Topography and Photogrammetry (LabTAF) at the University of Salento has long
            been engaged in the study of the ancient landscape, essentially through intensive field survey, the analysis
            of vertical and oblique multi-temporal aerial photographs and the development of a GIS system devoted to
            archaeological documentation. This integrated system of knowledge supports two main goals: sophisticated
            elaboration of complex datasets and practical possibilities for preservation of the archaeological heritage
            by providing efficient tools to the management of the territory and its cultural components. This
            contribution presents an analytic study of a sample area, chosen for its geomorphological characteristics
            and for its cultural complexity. This territory lies in the southern part of the Apulia Region, located
            between Lecce, the ancient Roman Lupiae, and its seaport at San Cataldo, along the Adriatic coast, covering
            about 85 km2 circa. Analysis of data from the field archaeological surveys, analysis of aerial photographs,
            archaeological aerial-survey and excavations revealed that the full functionality of the ancient harbour
            required the inland presence of a productive and receptive territory, with the distribution of rural
            settlements closely connected with the coast and the road system. The research presents an excellent
            opportunity for testing the potential of GIS systems in combination with conventional methodologies for
            landscape analysis, archaeological excavations and the application of new technologies.

        <Abstract>This survey focuses on the situation of the landscape and the ancient settlement of Lilybaeum in the
            countryside behind the modern centre of Mazara del Vallo. Based on the survey, the knowledge of the
            archaeological sites was applied to create an overview of the settlement dynamics in the territory. Evidence
            points to a widespread settlement, developed approximately from the end of the fourth century BC but
            established in the second century BC. It was linked mainly to the available water and environmental
            resources, especially agriculture, pastoralism, the quarries, the Mazaro River and to the easy possibility
            of trade, especially with North Africa. What stands out the most is the organisation of the settlements: it
            was possible to identify both large settlements and sometimes veritable villages, extending over several
            hectares, in this case similar to what has been found in other Sicilian districts, and to identify minor
            sites, probably functional to the villae or villages. The surface of a site in the San Miceli area, located
            near the banks of the Mazaro River, behind the port on the estuary of Mazara is exceptional. It has a very
            wide extension compared to other sites. Some of these sites, with remarkable signs of growth in the Late
            Imperial Age, especially in the fourth-fifth centuries AD, do not seem to survive beyond the sixth-seventh
            centuries AD. In a few cases we witness a continuum in the settlement, albeit in different forms compared to
            the previous periods, almost until the eleventh century AD in sites tied to the presence of wells, mills
            and, presumably, a road network. It was possible to redact an archaeological map from the archaeological
            data collected in the territory.

        <Abstract>The special position occupied in prehistoric research by the proto-urban centre of Verucchio in
            southern Romagna can be explained not only in the extraordinary finds that have been made in its necropolis
            but also in its position as an Etruscan bridgehead in Umbrian territory. However, the history of the origins
            of the settlement and its zone of influence are largely unexplored. The project Verucchio: City Development
            and Trade Links, Eleventh-Seventh Century BC, supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), aims to address
            this desideratum at various levels such as survey, settlement patterns, trade routes and raw material
            supply. Research focuses on the areas directly adjacent to the valley of the river Marecchia, the main trade
            route between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic coast in this area. Between 2009 and 2013 an
            archaeological landscape survey was successfully carried out and will be completed in 2015. Particular
            attention is being paid to topographically favoured hilltops and plateaus. In most of these locations
            archaeological remains with varying degrees of clarity can be identified through systematic site
            inspections. During the previous five survey campaigns more than 200 sites dating from the Stone Age to the
            Roman Imperial Age have been located. This preliminary paper aims to give an overview of the most important
            known and some of the newly discovered archaeological sites in the Marecchia Valley.

        <Abstract>This study focuses on the analysis of the landscape in the territory of the colony of Himera. In
            particular, this work is inspired by a detailed examination conducted on the basis of parametric modelling,
            which has helped us to understand what factors (pedology, altimetry, geology, supply basins, etc.) had an
            effect in the settlement choices of the Imerese territory during the Colonial Age. We analysed the role
            intervisibility had between sites in the organisation of the landscape. By avoiding a deterministic logic,
            we intersected the data from previous surveys on the development of predictive models with the
            archaeological data, formulating hypotheses on the role that the main settlements in the area had on the
            control and economic management of the territory.

        <Abstract>This study presents the results of topographic research on the Salento territory with a particular
            focus on the coast. The distribution of the coastal settlements, especially in prehistoric times, developed
            with a continuous chain of settlements, placed almost regularly along the Salento coast. The study of the
            aerophotographic documents has allowed the identification of large traces from residual moisture that would
            suggest the existence of some marsh basins, which would place certain settlements in one location, extremely
            isolated and protected, between sea and river. These conditions widely occur in both Salento coasts. In a
            few cases the same conditions can also be found in hinterland settlements where there are humid areas or
            seasonal wetlands. It seems clear that the archaeological sites of considerable size, milestone studies of
            traditional Italian prehistoric research (such as Scoglio del Tonno, Saturo, Torre Castelluccia, etc.), are
            characterised by the presence of a significant quantity of imported Aegean pottery and fortification works
            that often require great commitment and consistency. They alternate with minor settlements, sometimes
            equipped with fortifications as in the case of Bagnara, Torre Castiglione or Porto Badisco. A varied
            landscape also includes the large port facilities such as Brindisi, Taranto and Otranto, small landings,
            production sites and settlements of “purpurarii” (settlements dedicated to the extraction of purple pigment
            from gastropod molluscs). The preliminary results show complex situations, often not detected during the
            excavation work of the past, which may be better understood with systematic and extensive archaeological
            investigations, as is clear in the extraordinary evidence of the on going research in Rocavecchia.

        <Abstract>This paper is focused on the territories of San Lorenzello, Guardia Sanframondi and Cerreto Sannita
            (district of Benevento, Campania), in the eastern area of the Ager Telesinus, along the route to the
            Apennines mountains through the Volturno, Titerno and Calore valleys. The research is related to the Project
            of the Archaeological Map of the Northern Campania, coordinated by S. Quilici Gigli. This territory has
            important archaeological risk, as archaeological records testify, including hill-forts with polygonal walls,
            the town of Telesia, the necropoleis and the ruins of the villae in the suburbium. The current expansion of
            the survey to both the eastern and western sectors offers a larger point of view to analyse wide-ranging
            topics such as the pre-Roman settlement and the interregional roads. New data are emerging on the
            prehistoric and protohistoric ages in the territory of Guardia Sanframondi, in the wide alluvial area
            closest to the Calore River. In the territory of San Lorenzello and Cerreto Sannita, new data was been
            collected by the author on a settlement of the pre-Roman times in the zones overlooking the Titerno valley.
            Studies and surveys in this area have had operating implications. Maps of archaeological risk, based on the
            archaeological map of the Ager Telesinus, were produced, thanks to collaboration between the University,
            Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici and the local Government, with the goal of creating a common strategy
            for land-use planning.

        <Abstract>In the Ager Faliscus, recent systematic surveys nearby the stream Fosso di Fustignano have revealed a
            complex system of landscape management in Antiquity, recorded by the inscription CIL XI 7505, speaking about
            grazing lands (prata) in the Republican Age. The system has been described by A. Pasqui and partially
            positioned by S. Quilici Gigli. Recent explorations have allowed the location once again of the inscription
            nearby via Amerina and the discovery of a series of archaeological elements allowing the reconstruction of a
            complex system of organisation of the agricultural landscape strictly linked to the main viability. A
            well-turned structure of irrigation and drainage of the acreages proximal to the stream composed the work of
            C. Egnatius recorded in the epigraphy. Two different engineering solutions have been used, founded on the
            payload of the stream. Where the flow rate was minor, narrow rocky drains were realised to limit the range
            of the bed, to increase the level of the river and to permit the irrigation of the surrounding lands by a
            series of locks. The inscription of C. Egnatius is located just in front of one of these channels.
            Downstream, the irrigation system became more complex, using powerful dams. Outside one of these channels
            another inscription (Pr(ivatus?) Elix / Hic [-] VX [---]) may be concerned with the end of the water system
            and, at the same time, advises on the beginning of the area designated as private property. This
            interpretation corroborates the theory (already supported by aerophotointerpretation) of the presence of
            rural divisions in this area. The regular grid has an eight actus modulus and via Amerina constitutes the
            kardo. Then the work of C. Egnatius is simultaneous and inside the rural reorganisation of the Faliscan
            landscape in the aftermath of the Roman occupation.

        <Abstract>This paper summarises data gathered from an inter-regional research project conducted through land
            surveys, stratigraphic studies and the stratigraphic analysis of upstanding structures, within a program of
            the Department of Medieval Archaeology at the University of Urbino “Carlo Bo”. Surveys were carried out in
            the valley of the Marecchia River, Italy. The river flows through two regions, Emilia-Romagna and Marche,
            and two provinces, Rimini and Pesaro-Urbino. The project, which began in 2006, aims at presenting a
            diachronic landscape reconstruction by analysing landscapes transformation processes, from the Roman Age to
            the Renaissance. Special attention is devoted to the Middle Ages, the phenomenon of encastellation and to
            historical buildings. Within the project, extremely important, especially for the Middle Ages, are the
            surveys, carried out for the past 14 years at the archaeological site of the Castle of Monte Copiolo,
            hometown of the Counts of Montefeltro, who would later become Dukes of Urbino.

        <Abstract>This work aims to present a research project on the landscapes of the ancient Appian Way in the area
            east of Benevento. The project, sponsored by the Soprintendenza Archeologica in collaboration with the
            University of Salerno, was born from the desire to deal, in an organic way, with the topographic
            reconstruction of the Appian roadway through a wider project of reconstruction of ancient landscapes. The
            Appian route, from Benevento, has been debated by various scholars who have provided several hypotheses. In
            particular, the road out of the city, headed east to Aeclanum. Its route to Ponte Rotto on the Calore River
            has not been identified yet and the studies carried out up to now are not certain of its topographical
            identification. What is known is that there had to be, just outside of the city, a statio, Nucriola or
            Nuceriola, located on the fourth mile, and the next ad Calorem, which probably was on the site of Ponte
            Rotto. The project Ancient Appia Landscapes wants to test the signs on the ground, the archaeological traces
            that these assumptions produced, trying to reconstruct not only the layout of the road, but also in a
            broader context, where the ancient settlement dynamics can be valued as a whole not as just an individual
            monument or road stretch. In this perspective, the research covers various methods and tools of
            investigation (the study of archives, historical maps, paleobotanical analysis, surface surveys, aerial
            photography interpretation, geomorphological surveys). Since 2010, a fieldwork characterised by systematic
            and thematic survey of particular sites started: while the surveys for particular sites allowed the
            retrieval of archaeological, monumental and accurate information in the area east of Benevento, the
            systematic surveys proposed the implementation of transects based on the geomorphological characteristics of
            the area. Since July 2011, a first campaign of thematic research concerning one of the assumptions of the
            reconstruction of the road network proposed in the early ’900 by Meomartini started. Intensive surveys
            provided the division of the territory in reconnaissance units measured on the morphology, on the surface
            visibility and on the division of land. From the first analysis of the context of findings accurate and
            aerial data emerged allowing to propose a topographical reconstruction of the route of the Consular way in a
            large and articulated settlement system.

        <Abstract>The paper concerns three research projects promoted during the last 20 years by the University of
            Tuscia, aimed at the reconstruction of the ancient topography of areas inside southern Etruria, between
            Viterbo and the Tiber river valley; they are based on the systematic exploration of the territory and the
            production of archaeological maps. Two of these works, regarding the Ager Ciminius and
            Bomarzo-Bassano-Mugnano areas were completed and published in the series Carta Archeologica d’Italia -
            Contributi; the title of the series relates to the first project in the archaeological mapping of the
            national territory, performed in the last decades of the nineteenth century. The third research project,
            still in progress, regards the territory surrounding Viterbo, and between the city itself and the ancient
            settlement of Ferento and Acquarossa. The research projects produced archaeological maps aimed at supporting
            both the reconstruction of historical processes in a diachronic perspective and the activities in
            preservation of the archaeological heritage conducted by the Soprintendenza Archeologica per l’Etruria
            Meridionale. The systematic research activities allowed the collection of many new data about the ancient
            topography of these areas from the Proto-historic Age to the Medieval period, across the Etruscan and Roman
            epochs. The settlement pattern, the necropolises, the road networks, the rural and productive activities
            were studied and reconstructed. In general, the new data are very numerous in comparison to those previously
            known. Moreover, field-walking also provided the opportunity to document the condition of preservation of
            the archaeological evidence. In particular, in the area surrounding Viterbo, many ancient remains damaged or
            destroyed by new urbanisation and infrastructures are documented (also in comparison to the data documented
            during the surveys performed in the same territory at the beginning of 1970s). In the other two study areas,
            the most numerous damages are produced by mechanised agricultural works.

        <Abstract>For over twenty years, the Università degli Studi della Tuscia has carried out and coordinated surveys
            in Southern Etruria, today’s province of Viterbo. These investigations are performed with traditional
            methods (collection of all kinds of data and their analysis, systematic field-walking and so on) combined
            with the employment of the latest technological applications. The area covered by these surveys is very wide
            (from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Tiber River) and equally wide is the span of the connected studies, ranging
            from prehistoric to post-medieval periods. The deep geo-morphological diversities of this region have
            influenced, in the course of time, the occupation of the territory, its exploitation and settlement
            patterns. This research project has been partially motivated by the intention to fill a gap in our knowledge
            of a region which is very close to Rome and which has not been thoroughly examined until recently. The aim
            of this work is not only to redo a “census” of all the archaeological evidence of the territory but also to
            provide analysis according to coherent chronological phases or to specific topics (road-systems,
            distribution and typology of settlements, human activities and so on). A part of the data collected so far
            has been published in monographs by those responsible for the various surveys. In this paper, an overall
            presentation of the results will be outlined, with more general reflections on archaeological data and their
            potentiality in the field of the protection of cultural heritage (from preventive archaeology to the
            landscape planing).

        <Abstract>Topographical studies in the last decades have greatly improved our knowledge of Roman Panormus
            (modern day Palermo) but many aspects of its urban planning still remain obscure. It is very hard work to
            clearly understand a city that has been continuously inhabited from at least the Iron Age to the present.
            This long standing existence implies countless transformations of its urban aspect. In particular the Arab
            domination, in the Middle Ages, erased even the memory of the ancient place names, so the toponomastic
            source that is often a fundamental tool for the ancient topographer is almost useless. Using the typical
            sources of ancient topography and landscape archaeology and its multidisciplinary approach can be
            exceedingly useful in understanding the ancient aspect of a living city. We found an important lack of
            information about ancient Palermo: the location of buildings designed for public spectacles. The epigraphic
            sources prove that in Palermo there was a theatre and an amphitheatre; from a Late-Antique source we can
            assume that there was also a circus. This paper’s aim is to suggest concrete hypotheses to identify the
            locations of all three of these buildings, discuss their position and their relation to the civic plan of
            Panormus. These results are important in understanding this city in a more complete way but also for the
            protection of its archaeological heritage: these three areas lie outside the ancient walls of Palermo and
            have hitherto been considered “low-risk areas” for archaeology. manifestations

        <Abstract>In this paper we present the geoarchaeological and landscape project on the Upper Agri Valley
            (Basilicata). Between 2012 and 2015 we coordinated multidisciplinary research with the purpose of
            reconstructing the history and evolution of the territory, analysing the relationships between man and
            landscape from the Prehistory to the Middle Age. The studied area, an inland mountain valley situated in the
            ancient Lucania, is very important, because it is a fundamental route between the two coasts of Magna
            Graecia and because during the Roman period this valley was the territory in which Grumentum was born, one
            of the most important towns of Roman Southern Italy. Thanks to the dialogue between different competences,
            this project aims at understanding the settlements dynamics and the mutual influences between man and
            environment: indeed, we conducted geophysics and geoarchaeological investigations, archaeological surveys,
            cartographic and aerial photos studies, written sources analysis: in this way, different data are used to
            understand the landscape from a global point of view.

        <Abstract>“Knowledge” of all kinds of evidence is important for scientists and researchers but it is also
            necessary for the protection and development of territory. It is, at the same time, the requisite basis for
            the right management of the territory and correct planning as it is also support for competent territorial
            administrations. This paper describes how the Italian National GIS for Cultural Heritage collects, records
            and presents archaeological and environmental data from several Regions for use in planning and other
            management regimes.

        <Abstract>Data gathered by survey, photointerpretation of historical and recent aerial photographs, archives,
            bibliography, local bibliography and oral information, give an interesting picture of population settlement
            patterns in the Region of Abruzzo. Since prehistoric periods, the area along the Royal Sheep Track (Tratturo
            Regio) has been controlled by hilltop settlements as an ancient commercial route. The settlement pattern, on
            a local scale, still survives today.

        <Abstract>The increasing sophistication and complexity of archaeological models has precluded easy testing of
            such models, and oftentimes requires assessments that can be as lengthy and complicated as the initial model
            design and execution. Here, a multi-criteria decision-based model developed to simulate hunter-gatherer land
            use decisions in the Post-Glacial Netherlands is discussed. To approximate when and where uncertainty
            occurs, a sensitivity analysis is implemented that involves varying input parameter weights to determine
            those parameters with the greatest potential impact on model output. This process incorporates linked
            combinations of statistical and qualitative tests that are unique to each stage of the modeling. While the
            sensitivity analysis described allows modellers to become better acquainted with both their models and data
            – and the inherent limitations that lie therein – the utility of such a heuristic exercise is debatable.
            Thus, another approach is proposed that involves running two spatial analyses that target the same question
            of human land use decision-making from different directions and harnessing different data. This procedure
            has the ability to provide archaeological modellers with a better approximation of the robustness of each
            spatial analysis, especially when the two analyses converge upon similar answers. When the spatial analyses
            do not produce similarly patterned results, we know it is time to go “back to the drawing board” and
            reassess the meta-issue of whether the questions we are asking can be answered via our modeling
            abstractions. These issues are of no small import because if archaeological models are to resonate with
            researchers conducting similar simulative and decision-based models in other fields, then we must implement
            comparable post-process tests on our models too.

        <Abstract>This study forms part of a larger project analysing the development of the cultural landscape in the
            Dutch Roman limes region, including the development of the rural economy. The primary research aim in this
            study is to investigate changes in pastoral production as a result of differing population dynamics of sheep
            and cattle herds subjected to different animal husbandry practices. Differences between such practices have
            not been considered in previous models of pastoral production in the region where herds have been treated as
            static entities. In this study we simulated different animal husbandry strategies based on trends and
            developments inferred from the faunal record in a well-documented area of the limes zone. The results of
            these simulations were analysed for differences in population viability, as well as relative differences in
            production of meat, wool and manure, and relative requirements for pastureland requirements and labour. Our
            analysis shows that cattle and sheep herds exploited for products supplied by the animals whilst living
            (manure and traction from cattle, wool from sheep) exhibit higher growth rates than herds exploited for
            meat. In addition, they are able to supply larger quantities of calories. However these herds have higher
            requirements for labour and land, presenting a possibly limiting factor. We conclude that, in addition to
            complementing intensification and extensification of arable farming observed in the region, agriculturalists
            would have benefitted from herds with higher growth rates, particularly given their risk-aversion behavior
            during periods of economic uncertainty. These simulations will be subsequently used to produce more nuanced
            scenarios of pastoral production within agent-based modelling of the mixed rural economy in the Dutch Roman
            limes zone.

        <Abstract>This paper describes a method to calculate a “land use heritage map” based on the concept of “memory
            of landscape”. Such a map can be seen as one variable among many others that can influence site location
            preference and can be used as input for archaeological predictive models. The computed values equate to an
            index of long-term land use intensity. This index aims to assess the influence of previous occupation of the
            landscape on settlement location, in particular Roman rural settlements. The method was applied on a
            micro-region located in Southern France in order to test its workability. It is concluded that the method is
            potentially suitable for incorporating the influence of previous occupation in predictive modelling but
            still needs further refinement in order to be more generally applicable.

        <Abstract>In this research locations are selected in Southern Flevoland (Central Netherlands) which are most
            likely to contain archaeological remains dating to the Younger Dryas (YD) (12,900-11,700 cal BP). To map and
            determine these locations two steps are performed: 1) The Pleistocene surface of Southern Flevoland is
            classified into landforms using a GIS application based on Topographic Position Index.2) Data on the
            geomorphological setting and the distance to the nearest freshwater source of well-dated YD archaeological
            sites in the Northwest European Plain are extrapolated to the study area. The inductive predictive model
            indicates that elevated areas in close proximity to a freshwater source have the highest probability to
            contain YD archaeological remains. For potential Federmesser remains a maximum distance of 1500 m from the
            Eem fluvial system is estimated and for potential Ahrensburgian remains a maximum distance of 2500 metres.
            The areas with potential YD archaeological remains constitute less than 10% of the total study area. The
            detailed and well-preserved Pleistocene surface in the study area, combined with potentially well-preserved
            YD remains due to the Holocene sediment cover, is of major importance for future studies on landscape
            exploitation by prehistoric hunter – fisher – gatherers. Reconstructing landscape exploitation opens up new
            avenues to study subsistence economy, settlement patterns and spatial organisation of past societies.

        <Abstract>In this paper we present the first results of a study that aims to better understand and model the
            size and development of population in the Dutch Roman limes zone, as part of a larger research project
            investigating the development of the cultural landscape in the area. Earlier estimates of population size
            have only used general assumptions based on settlement density and supposed Roman army recruitment
            requirements and have not considered in any detail the factors influencing population growth and decline.
            This paper first presents the existing evidence for estimating population size in the area and then
            discusses the evidence for mortality and fertility estimates in the Roman period, necessary to better
            understand the large-scale demographic processes involved. From this evidence, new estimates for population
            size in the Early and Middle Roman period are calculated, using agent-based modelling to better understand
            the dynamics of population growth and the effects of recruitment of soldiers by the Roman army. It is
            concluded that earlier calculations underestimated the potential for population growth as well as the effect
            of forced recruitment on demography.

        <Abstract>Landscape archaeology is a broad field that seeks to place what we consider “archaeological” into a
            spatial context, whether that be literal, theoretical, or conceptual. With more recent approaches to
            social-spatial simulation (through GIS or agent-based modelling techniques) this has entailed complex
            mathematical methods or procedures which can be quite difficult to evaluate or even understand as a
            representation of past human activity. It could be said that archaeological remains often drive the
            construction of the simulation, or conversely that social complexity is expected to organically emerge from
            simple programmed “rules” of behaviour in a frictionless or highly generalised manifold. Naturally, the
            result has been models that have been dismissed as missing the point, or being too simplistic to be of any
            use because they neither consider past people’s cognitive intentions nor the material remains that have been
            eradicated by taphonomic processes. Perhaps we need to redefine what it is that interests us as
            archaeologists. Is it finding sites, features and artefacts? Or is it understanding past human behaviour in
            the context of objective-oriented mechanisms, preferably within a spatial framework? If it is the latter,
            then maybe we need to look at modelling human energetics as both a past “spatial currency” and as a primary
            unit of analysis. Sites, artefacts and features are by-products in the human expression of energy across the
            landscape, and they should be defined and used as such in understanding and evaluating complex spatial
            models. A large-scale GIS simulation of the first century BC Helvetian subsistence economy (an on-going
            project) is used to illustrate these ideas.

        <Abstract>This paper explains the genesis of the Seeing heritage through the lenses of landscape session
            organised at the LAC 2014 conference by the CHeriScape network. It introduces seven papers presented at the
            conferences (and summarises three others), contextualising them in the symbiotic relationship between
            landscape and heritage within modern European society, and draws from them, under the general themes used in
            the CHeriScape network, a series of common threads and conclusions that contribute to CHeriScape’s agenda.
            The discourse is located within the frame of three recent European policy documents, the European Landscape
            Convention, the Faro Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society and the ESF/COST Science
            Policy Briefing on landscape. The conclusions form part of the process of increasing the social relevance of
            landscape archaeology and its potential contribution to the grand challenges commonly identified in current
            policy-making debates.

        <Abstract>The Italian Archaeological Mission in Iraqi Kurdistan (MAIKI) of the Sapienza University of Rome aims
            to study the archaeological, historical, linguistic and cultural development of the Kurdish region through a
            wide historical period. MAIKI started by focusing on the archaeological and philological analysis of the
            Sasanian site of Paikuli. In recent years, however, investigation has been expanded to include an accurate
            survey of the area between the Dyala and Basara rivers, around the main road that connects the city of
            Chamchamal to Darbandikhan, in order to implement a complete and updated archaeological map of the entire
            territory. The continuing work includes a preparatory study of the few bibliographical records available and
            an overall analysis of the accessible, current and historical satellite imagery in order to obtain a
            reliable context for the results of archaeological field surveys. During the field campaigns, which are
            currently suspended because of the political instability and war in the region, archaeological material was
            collected in all the visited sites and a detailed morphological and archaeometric study was set up. A
            complete map of the currently inhabited villages of the area has been compiled because up-to-date base
            cartography of the area did not exist; this new map has proved to be useful not only for locating
            archaeological records but also for the activities of the ethnological research that joined the Mission in
            2013. The area suffered very much during Saddam Hussein’s Al-Anfal campaign when all of the people were
            forced to leave. The ethnological study will help to reveal the impact that these recent traumatic events
            have had on the preservation of the cultural heritage whilst supplying rich documentation for further
            investigation, including on relationship between man and territory, local economy, migration policies and
            religious practices.

        <Abstract>The Prehistoric Ethnographic National Museum “Luigi Pigorini” holds one of Europe’s most important
            collections of prehistoric archaeological material with contexts excavated beginning at the end of the
            nineteenth century. This paper illustrates the first steps towards a digitised model of the archives and of
            the Museum collection with the aim of refreshing the Museum’s memory by restoring lost connections between
            the landscape context and the historical documents of archaeological research (including old photographs,
            registers, notes and sketches). The methodological approach begins with the experience of the project SITAR,
            the web-based GIS of the Superintendence for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome. It intends to develop
            geographically-focused solutions to share the knowledge of the Museum with local communities and to
            highlight the connections between prehistoric finds and the current landscape, thus contributing to the
            formation of the community’s identity. This process intends to move the Museum towards a dynamic dimension
            and make it more accessible and meaningful for contemporary users.

        <Abstract>This paper briefly shows the use of an analysis of a large number of IGM 1930 glass slide negatives
            and an accurate photo-interpretation of cropmarks to create a particular view of the territory of ancient
            Caere, almost 30 km NW of Rome. This territory was covered by a great number of tumuli and tombs of
            different kind, giving a very strong and impressive sensation of power and wealth. Topographical analysis of
            the case study area by direct survey, field-checking and revision of previous data and pertinent
            documentation (bibliographic, public and private archives and information in loco, etc.) was accompanied by
            examination and analysis of historical and recent aerial photographs from different archives, with
            additional monitoring flights over areas of risk. The aim was to obtain an historical perspective of the
            territory to help the protection of cultural heritage remains, meet the need for the establishment of a
            global Cultural Heritage cadastre connected to studies for legal protection and enjoyment of great interest
            sites, and finally, not least, for a correct territorial planning.

        <Abstract>Long considered by many historians as an “internal colony” (Haynes, 1997), the cultural landscape of
            the coalfields of McDowell County, southern West Virginia (USA) displays a palimpsest of political, social,
            cultural and environmental history. Drawing out some of the most valuable coal in the world, Pocahontas
            “smokeless” (McGehee, 2012), the grip of absentee landholders (Myers, 2008) on the region is reflected in
            legible traces on the land. Investigating remnant industrial terrain, modelled using LiDAR, brings patterns
            to the surface for interpretation and typological analysis (Opitz, 2012). From early mining forms, wildcat
            and prospect mines, to tunnel and later Mountain Top Removal (MTR), the morphology of the landscape evolved
            in line with machine technology and reflects the history of place. Communities constructed as work camps
            reveal an ordered geometry of control, a mnemonic of “corporate paternalism” (Garay, 2011); while the
            buildings of Gary, West Virginia, a US Coal and Coke Company model town evoke a Utopian efficiency and
            economy. Post-1950s boom time McDowell County counted 100,000 residents with cluttered Main Streets and
            overflowing rail lines. Today the population has dwindled to near 20,000 and the memory of early twentieth
            century industry in the “Free State of McDowell” is fast being erased either through neglect, abandonment or
            conscious elimination. MTR mining and the practice of filling valleys with waste rock obliterates topography
            at an unprecedented scale. Abandoned camps are washed away from the floodplain or intentionally removed.
            Smaller scale mining operations are swept away as new technologies raise the economic viability of thin coal
            seams. As the landscapes, communities, and buildings of McDowell County are reorganised and reshaped, a
            methodology for analysis through remote sensing and ground-truthing (Doenus et al, 2008; Gallagher &amp;
            Josephs, 2008; Horne, 2009) informs interpretive strategies in capturing narratives of place.

        <Abstract>This paper presents research on the historic urban settlement and natural landscape between the Göreme
            and Kiliclar (Swords) valleys, located in Kapadokya, one of the most distinctive human and natural
            landscapes in the world, inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985. The research was part of the
            Italian Scientific Research Programs of Relevant National Interest (PRIN) programme Rupestrian Art and
            Habitats in Kapadokya (Turkey) and in Central and Southern Italy – Rock, Excavated Architecture, Painting:
            Between Knowledge, Preservation and Enhancement. The study area has all the features of rupestrian
            Mediterranean culture, encompassing a heritage developed over time with environmental, architectural and
            artistic elements. It tells a special story about ancient life, completing and widening our comprehension of
            the past. There are buildings of great architectural and pictorial qualities, such as the Tokali Kilise,
            Saint Eustachius and Saint Daniel, where it is still possible to read the old defensive system and the local
            way of life. Yet these cave settlements are at risk from deterioration. The research is centred on survey,
            especially on a digital survey carried out using 3D laser scanners for the architecture as well as of the
            natural stone structure of the settlement. In this way the first complete and detailed documentation of this
            area has been created, allowing the first studies on the urban character of this archaeological site. The
            research presented here will show a fully digital approach using 3D digital models aimed to investigate,
            read, preserve the information and disseminate the artistic and cultural values otherwise not easily
            accessible and continuously at risk of loss because of decay processes.

        <Abstract>The dominant perceptual sense in western culture is certainly that of sight: the “vision” of the
            world, even in everyday language, tends to coincide with what is perceived as reality. Not surprisingly, our
            being in the world is increasingly defined from the perspective of a single “point of view”. The first
            consequence is the progressive absorption of the multisensory component, which inevitably characterises
            every act of perception, within the arrangements of an ever more debased and impoverished image. Landscape
            is an interface consisting of objects, situations and configurations that indicate precise locations of
            resources and meanings. Spatial configurations that allow the identification of a resource or a meaning can
            be both structural (such as a row of trees) and a type of energy (such as acoustic configurations or
            soundscape, or the light intensity, e.g. light spots within of a forest, or olfactory, e.g. smelling traces
            left by an animal). In this paper a case study is provided of some material contexts, examined through the
            conceptual lens of “soundscape” applied to archaeology. The examination of the sound components relates to
            pre-Roman Italy and involves the definition of “soundscape” as a subject of archaeological research.
            Soundscape frequently denotes the natural sound environment through its primary physical components such as
            the sounds of nature (wind, water, forests, birds, insects, animals), but it is also produced by human
            activity, and the outcomes of phonic instrumental artefacts and mechanical actions. The len is moved,
            therefore, from what is observed to what is heard; as regards archaeological analysis, data is projected
            onto culturally-contextualised acoustic scenery.

        <Abstract>‘The personal is political’ is one of Kate Millet’s most famous phrases. It refers to the mismatches
            between the needs of the citizenry and practices carried out by those in the political sphere. In our case,
            we can relate this to integrated heritage management, and more specifically, the policies implemented in
            recent years in rural contexts in Spain. This paper examines the case of the large number of Heritage
            Interpretation Centres, restoration of traditional structures, and archaeological excavations which were
            initiated from the 1990s by rural municipalities, with funding from the European Union (Leader Funds,
            mainly), but many of which a decade later have failed and been abandoned by public institutions. This paper
            argues that this was partly due to the lack of public participation in the development of these projects,
            which were managed vertically and asymmetrically, with the inhabitants of the towns excluded and unable to
            contribute their own vision. Future heritage management projects should be based on citizen participation
            and empowerment of the different local agents that are closer to heritage sites. Through a case study in
            northern Cáceres, a revitalisation of the rural northern Extremadura area is proposed based on sustainable
            heritage tourism and revolving around three key concepts: cultural landscape, heritage and empowerment. For
            this to be implemented successfully, we must deal with various characteristics which form the identity of
            the region, as well as the particular political development within northern Extremadura.
